All official media in CCP had no chance to access the content of the meeting. The intelligence that previously revealed by Lude was recounted after listening to recordings similar to this one, include the intelligence of the Wuhan military exercise meeting called &quot;Operation 9.18&quot; and the Xi'an Hemorrhagic fever military exercise meeting, and today is the first time the original recorded information has been played in public.
Lude has also listened to all the recorded conversations of Xi Jinping himself and those close to him, and all the evidence indicates that Xi Jinping is a stupid and self-opinionated man. Things that people of ordinary intelligence find insane or unworkable, Xi Jinping is firmly convinced that it can be done by him.
Thus the Chinese war preparations revealed in this recording are Xi Jinping's pre-war mobilization for the coming war. The conference was aimed at the strategic military layout of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, which are adjacent to Guangdong. Divided into four sections：</p> <h2 id="part-1"><a href="#part-1" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 1</h2> <p>Part 1: Follow the instructions of &quot;Central Military Commission of the People’s Republic of China - Guangdong Provincial Party Committee - Southern Theater Command - Guangdong Military Region&quot; to transmit the instruction of the command level-by-level, fully comprehend the spirit and assignment and the issue mobilization command.</p> <p>Guangdong Province has already launched full-scale work of &quot;transition from peacetime to wartime&quot; (that is, Guangdong Province is into a state of war), which indicates that the following work will be dominated by wartime conditions. In the Chinese Communist Party system, the war zones are equivalent to the battlefield force system, and the provincial military regions are responsible for mobilizing the local militia before the war, which means mobilizing the resources of the &quot; civilian&quot; in the &quot;military-civilian fusion&quot;. The recording is talking about how to transfer the civilian resources of Guangdong Province into wartime resources.</p> <p>1、With &quot; rapidly establish a joint military-civil command party committee &quot;, &quot; initiate the Party - Government - Military - Police and Civilian joint defense and control mechanism, and Wartime Special Supervision System &quot; It means that the Military control has replaced the present peacetime social order.</p> <p>2、&quot;Ensure high efficient and effective transition from peacetime to wartime mechanism&quot; designated this meeting as a marker of the full transition from peacetime to the wartime mechanism in Guangdong Province.</p> <p>3、Using the experience and practices accumulated in the prevention and control of the Covid-19 in previous years as an initiative for social prevention and control in wartime. Here also mentioned &quot;to adjust the focus of work from grasping economic development to ensure strategic victory&quot; means to enter the state of military control all the lockdown and the restrictions are for the purpose of warfare. Therefore, the previous city lockdown and restrictions under the compulsory “zero-tolerance” strategy was CCP’s smokescreen. Similarly, North Korea's current prevention and restriction measure due to the outbreak of Covid-19 is also aimed at a full transition from peacetime to a wartime mechanism , a judgment made based on intelligence by Lude Media.</p> <p>4、The three aspects of &quot;analyzing and assessing our province's potential resources and revising and completing the mobilization strategy&quot; mean that the economy of Guangdong Province has entered a wartime state, and when it enters a wartime state, all economic activities are conducted by military directives, and economic and trade activities during the peacetime will become non-functional.</p> <p>5、&quot; Regarding the organization and implementation, it is necessary to coordinate economically developed cities and relatively backward areas, general industry fields and major industry fields&quot;, and to explicitly mandate high-tech enterprises to &quot; convert and expand the production&quot;. The &quot;conversion&quot; refers to the shift to missile production, and the &quot;expansion&quot; refers to the large-scale production of missiles in Xi'an and other cities, all of which Lude Media had gained from insider intelligence provided by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, which also mentioned that Russian missiles are produced in China. The mission to convert and expand production now landed on the Guangdong Provincial Military Commission. We have implemented the strategy of giving cheap products to the &quot;prison industries&quot; and diverting high-end products to military supplies.</p> <p>6、Emphasizes the conversion of civilian enterprises to military enterprises should be &quot; self-conscious &quot; and voluntary. &quot; Do not spare a battle to crush Taiwan's independence and the intentions of powerful enemies&quot;, the &quot;powerful enemies&quot; refers to the United States. This implies that the strategic ambitions of the PLA  are not limited to Taiwan, but also the United States. The Chinese Communist Party is accelerating its preparations for war, but they will not attack Taiwan by &quot;militarized force&quot; very soon. It will be a war without weapons, it will be a war that is initiated by  hidden force among the ordinary people.</p> <p>7、Li Xi ,Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, personally confirmed that China is at risk of cutting-off the industrial chain at the meeting, implying that the top leadership of the CCP has already been aware of the complete decoupling of China and the United States.</p> <p>8、The meeting mentioned that “close to our province’s border with Hong Kong and Macao and long sea defenses, we must carefully guard against enemy invasion and sabotage, prevent the intention of using  Hong Kong to disrupt China, to disrupt the launched warfare. The CCP's sentence of life imprisonment for Mr. Ma  (Twitter name: YA YA), a participant in the Chinese &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; movement, is a harsh example of guarding against enemy invasion and sabotage. Moreover, for the purpose of controlling Hong Kong more quickly, the Chinese Communist Party made Li Jiachao, a police officer, the Chief Executive to prevent &quot;using Hong Kong to disrupt China and to disrupt the launched warfare&quot;. These practices are all for China's stability maintenance and eliminating interference and disruption during the PLA's attacks on Taiwan and the United States. In China, only Xi Jinping has the authority to declare a state of war and initiate war mobilization. It is obvious that the pre-war mobilization meeting of the Guangdong military region was ordered by Xi Jinping, and that a war state means all of China's personnel, financial and material resources are to be deployed and spent for war. Therefore, recent events happened in China, such as the evacuation of Chinese companies, restrictions on the entry and exit of Chinese, military recruitment, and restrictions on essential materials for the daily lives of the Chinese are all means of war mobilization. The next war mobilization tactics will include city lockdowns, curfews, and restrictions on population movement in the major war preparation provinces and cities; increased media censorship and even cut off internet access; and take up for &quot;spies&quot; or even anti-war individuals, the entire population has been in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.</p> <h2 id="part-2"><a href="#part-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 2</h2> <p>Part 2: Setting up a joint military-civil command center and combat command post, which will be specifically planned and deployed for the mission of the peace/war transition of the province. The meeting skipped the rehearsal of the startup of the transition from peacetime to wartime.</p> <p>1、Guangdong Province has completed the establishment of military-civil command center and ground command units by 18:00 on April 18, 2022. The command structure is organized into the provincial military-civilian joint headquarters, the South China Sea Battle command post, and several special task mobilization command posts.
“The dedicated command posts rely on the relevant military-civil industrial systems to have twelve sommand posts, including civil air defense, logistic mobilization, national economic mobilization, public propaganda, and safeguarding social stability and preventing chaos. “These words imply that in the future during wartime, the government machinery in the peacetime state will no longer work, and all judicial and administrative powers will be under the local joint military-civil command center. At which time the Chinese will be put into a state of military control.</p> <p>2、The conference mentioned “establish the command information link from the Joint Command Center of the Military Commission to the Joint Command Center of the theater, as well as to the provincial, municipal and county military joint command institutions; mainly rely on the joint combat command information system of the theater, and integrate the secret information remote delivery system into the joint combat system.” revealing that the communication system of the PLA is still stuck at a very out-dated level that was used during the Sino-Vietnam War in 1979. For which “the secret information remote delivery system” refers to the use of people to deliver intelligence. And that integrating  these legacy communication systems into the joint combat warfare, means that the PLA’s communication system has to use the internet to deliver intelligence by phone and people. It was because of this out-dated system of intelligence transmission that so much Chinese top-classified intelligence can be captured and delivered to Lude Media.</p> <p>3、The conference mentioned that &quot;the link from the Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission to the provincial military district leadership management information mainly relies on the 509+ platform&quot;. &quot;The command communication link from the provincial - city - county and military joint command units, mainly relying on ultra-shortwave and Tiangong-1 satellite phones, to establish mobile communications in motion&quot;, and &quot;the military to local command communication link, relying on the Acer Electronic Government Intranet Confidential Cryptography system interconnection &quot; revealing that the PLA's Joint Operations Command System appears to be very powerful and impressive, but in fact it is all over-packaged. For example, the &quot;509+ platform&quot; on which the link from the Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission to the leadership of the provincial military districts is based on World War II-era technology; secondly, &quot;relying on ultra-shortwave and Tiangong-1 satellite telephones to establish mobile communications in motion&quot; is the technical support on which the command communication link from the PLA's provincial - city - county and military command center. Among them, &quot;communication in motion&quot; refers to the ability to communicate in a moving military vehicle; In addition, the &quot;Acer E-Government Intranet Confidential Cryptography System&quot; on which the communication link between the army and local command relies is also very fragile, and will soon be paralyzed after the war. The &quot;quick conference system&quot; used for the Guangdong military district meeting this time is in the civilian standard and of very low-quality, reflecting the outdated standard of the PLA's communication system and operational command system.The intelligence described in detail the PLA's operational command system, communications system configuration, and the significantly different generation from the U.S. operational command system, which would give the free world the confidence to defeat the CCP.</p> <h2 id="part-3"><a href="#part-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 3</h2> <p>Part 3，Guangdong Province mission from the Eastern and Southern Theater Command, the National Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office, and the National Mobilization Committee. After the study and assessment, the tasks of Guangdong Province mainly have five parts: to ensure the decisive battle in the Taiwan Strait (victory),  be able to conduct extra long-range strike ( the distance strike capability maybe longer than 300 kilometers ),to participate in the unobstructed project in South China Sea, assist Hong Kong and Macao to maintain stability, and maintain the stability of the home front. Wang Weizhong, Guangdong Provincial Governor, in charge of reporting the Guangdong Provincial Defense Mobilization Center’s mobilization instruction, creating a three-zone deployment of mobilization, distributing five tasks (Recruitment, Maritime support mobilization, Resource mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities, Mobilization of equipment and materials, and Mobilization of ground defense forces), and conduct discussions around three key areas: the recruitment of troops, the mobilization of maritime support, and the mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities. In addition to the three key areas of discussion, Huang Shanchun, political commissar of the Guangdong Military Region, also made supplementary comments on overseas mobilization.</p> <p>1、The tasks of Guangdong Province come from the Eastern and Southern Theater Commands, the National Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office, and the National Movement Commission:</p> <p>First, the eastern and southern theaters have assigned a total of 20 categories and 239 mobilization tasks to the province, mainly 1,358 sub-units of various types with a total of 140,000 troops, 953 ships of various types, and 1,653 units/sets of various unmanned equipment. 20 airports and docks, 6 repair and shipbuilding yards, 14 emergency transfer centers, and other resources such as grain depots, hospitals, blood stations, oil depots, gas stations, etc. This is an order from the PLA Eastern and Southern War Zones to Guangdong Province, which is required to mobilize 140,000 non-active duty persons, to recruit or produce 953 civilian ships, and recruit or produce 1,653 units/set of unmanned equipment within a specified time limit ( including drones and unmanned ships). In addition, 20 airports and wharfs, and 6 repair and shipyards have been recruited. These recruited private enterprises will send military representatives to station there.</p> <p>Second, The Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office will recruit new conscrips, retired military personnel, special professionals in total 15,500 people&quot;, the recruitment of refers to the &quot;special professionals people&quot; is to recruit from large technology companies, such as Huawei that are capable of programming, electronics or high-tech engineers, as well as machinists, pliers and other professional technicians.</p> <p>Thirdly, the National Mobilization Committee clearly indicates that the potential strategic resources of the country in the region that will be coordinated and implemented in our province mainly include 64 10,000-ton trains/ships and vessel, 38 aircraft, 588 train cars and 19 civil facilities such as airports and houses.</p> <p>2、After the assessment, the task of Guangdong Province mainly has five parts:  to ensure the decisive battle in the Taiwan Strait (victory),  be able to conduct extra long-range strike ( the distance strike capability maybe longer than 300 kilometers ),to participate in the unobstructed project in South China Sea, assist Hong Kong and Macao to maintain stability, and maintain the stability of the home front.</p> <p>（1）Be able to conduct long-range strike ( Extra long distance strike capability, longer than 300 kilometers ), form the new ocean-going forces, to reconnaissance, submarine search, search and rescue outside the first island chain. The countries mentioned in the &quot;guaranteeing the forward deployment of Rocket Forces&quot; include Japan, the Philippines, and other countries. &quot;Ensuring the advanced deployment of the Rocket Force&quot; means that there must be sufficient personnel at sea to fill the attrition of fighters generated when the PLA Rocket Force pushes beyond the first island chain.</p> <p>(2) Assist in the task of maintaining stability in Hong Kong and Macau, &quot;organize border control, maintain the security of the livelihood of Hong Kong and Macau, and prevent the enemy from using Hong Kong to disrupt China.&quot; means that Hong Kong and Macao will under the PLA Guangdong Military Region management in a wartime state.</p> <p>(3) Among the tasks of maintaining the stability of the home front, &quot;assisting in guarding 61 important military targets and 276 important civilian targets&quot; is to prevent infiltration and sabotage by &quot;secret agents&quot; as defined by the Chinese Communist Party.</p> <p>3、Regarding recruitment, the Pearl River Delta has some of China's top talents from all fields, and the PLA needs to mobilize them all. Due to the current time limitations of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government has been able to identify citizens' personal information &quot;through their Big Data technology&quot; and to pinpoint who the PLA wants to recruit by analyzing personal assets, professional skills and qualifications, personal history, and travel patterns. In the meetings of the executive branch, the discussions are all about how to prevent and punish, and how to do whatever it takes to achieve the goal - which is the truly terrorist. The recruiters can be persuaded by repeated visits and intimidation. For those who do not cooperate with the recruitment, the punishment must be increased. China has also established measures to punish citizens who do not want to obey the recruitment process. Li Xi's suggestion for the conscription work is &quot;there are some people who are enthusiastically enrolled in the war, but there are also people who are afraid of war, timid to fight, and avoid war&quot; so we need more extensive propaganda, and much more powerful support. In addition, a follower added &quot;in addition to positive motivation, but also to intensify the punishment according to the law&quot;, that is, the individual who does not cooperate with the recruitment should meet with greater punishment according to the law. Lude Media keeps telling people to take precautions, and if it is unfortunate to be recruited, it will certainly become a casualty of war. China is not worthy of having its people fight for it. The reason for China's strictly and tightly controlled citizens leaving the country is to prevent the wastage of highly skilled individuals.</p> <p>4、 In maritime support and mobilization, it is mainly to deal with the heavy tasks of various ship projects, the high quality rate of crew members during wartime, and the adaptation rate of equipment. There are still some contradictions.</p> <p>(1) Regarding the issue of ship weaponization, “The task assigned by the Theater Command is to complete the weaponization of 365 ro-ro ships and other types of ships within 45 days. In addition, there are 64 ships occupied at the national level within the jurisdiction, and 8 ships are clearly under the responsibility of our province. There are 90 capable ship repair and construction enterprises in the province, which can organize a total of 113 ships to be weaponized at one time, and 280 ships can be completed within this month.” At present, the PLA intends to take three approaches &quot;First, the concentration of excellence, utilization of the province's large ship repair and shipbuilding plants to organize more than 1,000-ton transport vessels, adoption of classification and centralized implementation. Second, multi-point distribution, selected 23 docks in coastal cities, multi-point rapid organization of technical fishing vessels weaponization.
Third, cross-regional resource integration, selected ship repair work forces from Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Zhanjiang to strengthen the eastern part of Guangdong. The relevant work is recommended to be led by us, the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Economy organization will guide the cities to push  forward the implementation.&quot;
This piece of intelligence has tremendous military value; the PLA has testified to confirm that civilian docks and private enterprises have been used for military purposes and are no longer civilian, which would qualify them as military targets and allow the U.S. military to take targeted killings. The addition of weaponized vessels include 64 vessels of over 10,000 tons, the others are under 10,000 tons; 23 docks are responsible for weaponize fishing vessels, and the PLA is weaponizing all fishing vessels, which also means that there will be a large number of military weaponized vessels in the eastern part of Guangdong.&quot;strengthen the protection of ship repair facilities&quot; because the PLA believes that as long as they are civilian facilities, the U.S. will not focus on them as military targets. But now that the intelligence has been declassified and the evidence is conclusive, the U.S. military will definitely hit the weaponized civilian facilities mentioned in the meeting, so Lude Media urges workers engaged in ship modifications not to work on weaponized civilian ship, or risk losing their lives, and advises everyone to stay away from war.</p> <p>The &quot;weaponized program&quot; for the 10,000-ton roll-on/roll-off vessel and the &quot;formation of onboard militia and weapons&quot; are intended to weaponize the 10,000-ton roll-on/roll-off vessel for the purpose of disguising it and avoiding U.S. military identification during ocean voyages, and for the purpose of equipping it with missile systems. Since the meeting was an internal confidential meeting, that's why the participants were so open-mouthed and without worries.</p> <p>(2) Assignment of flotilla formation and people and equipment, the PLA's plan for the staffing of weaponized modified civilian ships is to &quot;optimize the militia on board and adopt a mixed grouping model of main crew, plus veterans, and equipment.  The arrangement of veterans and other military personnel on the ship, replacing the real crew, not only affects the efficiency of work, but also the civilian ship owners have to bear the wages of these PLA soldiers, which is a great loss for the civilian ship owners.</p> <p>Not only is the military region in Guangdong doing mobilization, but military regions in other Chinese provinces have also been holding similar meetings recently to mobilize for war. The meeting mentioned that &quot;the military cadres accompanying the ships with guns are organized into 3 brigades, 45 squadrons and 135 detachments according to the different items of protection and specific use. Prepare to accompany the ship 231 cadres, including 3 regimental positions, 45 battalion positions, 183 other military and local cadres&quot;,  the National Defense Mobilization Center proposed it needs 231 cadres on board, but there is still a shortage of active duty 68 cadres, and 91 local cadres, which is an important military intelligence. This means that it is difficult for the PLA to find experienced cadres at sea, and the 231 cadres on board are currently 68 short. The number of weaponized civilian ships can be calculated from here.</p> <p>&quot;Transferred from the mainland military divisions, especially those who have participated in major maritime defense operations, the Navy exchange in the regiment cadres, there are 57, can be added in accordance with the rules&quot;, this information verifies the Lude Media previous expose.</p> <p>5、Regarding the combat of novel-domains and capabilities mobilization, several issues such as the equipping of more than 2,000 pieces of high-tech equipment, network and power security during the war, and overseas mobilization were mainly emphasized.</p> <p>(1) More than two thousand pieces of high-tech equipments provided, the meeting mentioned that &quot; at present 480 unmanned aircraft and 70 unmanned boats in place. Need to accelerate the timing of the transfer control&quot;. &quot;On the UAV, the province's mobilization center confirmed the Shenzhen Alltech, Dongguan XX (likely to be Yang Hua) monthly production capacity of 80, it is recommended that the urgent mobilization of Shenzhen Smart Drone UVA, Dongguan Zhongchuang Intelligent Equipment and Guangzhou Hopong Helicopter Remote and other nine enterprises with this production capacity to work together to complete&quot;. &quot;The province's unmanned boat mobilization center Zhuhai Yunzhou, and Jianglong Shipbuilding monthly production capacity can be 90. Both of these tasks can be completed (enterprise name to be verified)&quot;, the exposure of these companies will allow the U.S. to pay more attention on  the production capacity of drones, unmanned boats and related equipment.</p> <p>(2) Wartime network and power security, Guangdong Province, through the &quot;mobilization of key high-tech enterprises, such as JiAnxin, Huawei&quot;, as well as &quot;strengthen surveillance and early warning security protection of information systems in the financial, energy, power and transportation industries,&quot; to ensure that the security grid defense of key areas will not be lost.</p> <p>(3) For overseas mobilization, Huang Shanchun, Political Commissar of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, mentioned: &quot;By using the methods of covering the army with the people and supporting the army with the people, combining risks and mobilizing the purchase of high-end chips, precision machinery, special materials and other materials that are in short supply in China, as well as petroleum , grain, minerals and other large-scale strategic reserve materials,to crack the dilemma of the U.S. and Western alliances on my strategic materials siege during wartime, vigorously mobilize overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese groups, actively participate in supporting and safeguarding my military operations, increase the introduction of special professionals, aim to all resources worldwide can be used for me, to ensure that foreign aid within the effective, efficient and achievable.&quot; It means that the top CCP has long been aware of the imminent sanctions and blockade of the United States against China, and has been purchasing materials through the Belt and Road Initiative and overseas military-civilian integration projects. The Lude Media has long told everyone that the complete decoupling of the Sino-US industrial chain is unstoppable. The CCP has launched overseas spies like Guo Wengui to infiltrate the US political circles in an attempt to influence the decision to decouple the US from the Chinese industrial chain.</p> <p>For the summary of the third part of the meeting, the commander mentioned that &quot;first, strengthening the awareness of the overall situation, focusing on reunification, containing a strategic victory, is the battle of unification, the battle of rejuvenation, can only succeed can not fail, Implement the decision-making intention of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, strengthen political awareness, overall awareness, order awareness, resolutely implement, all energy, focus on the war, all work serves the war, all resources are inclined to war, in order to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland and the greatness of the nation Rejuvenation contributes to Guangdong's strength.&quot;</p> <hr> <h2 id="part-4"><a href="#part-4" class="header-anchor">#</a> Part 4</h2> <p>The fourth part: Zhou He, the commander of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, studied and planned ground defense combat missions, and emphasized that &quot;strategic decisive victory: it is a battle of unification, a battle of revival, and it can only succeed but not fail.&quot;</p> <p>1、The ground defense operations of the four cities in eastern Guangdong are under the command of the Eastern Theater Command, and 7,000 people are led by the Guangdong Armed Police Corps to participate. From this, it can be seen that the PLA claims to have several million troops, but in fact they are scattered and the local troops are very weak. Even Lude Media has already exposed the news that the CCP's local military deployment, due to its limited mobilization ability, will not deploy more troops in the four cities of eaeastern Guangdong in the short term.</p> <p>2、The meeting mentioned that &quot;important defense targets include important military targets such as theater joint operations command center and maritime operations sub-center, as well as important civilian targets such as Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and South China Power Grid.&quot; Targets in modern warfare are destroyed almost before the battle. This time, the actual capabilities of the PLA's military and defense deployments have been exposed, and the level of its capabilities is shockingly low.</p> <p>3、The meeting mentioned that &quot;there are two options for the use of other assigned forces. First, the centralized use of the Armed Police Guangzhou General Force Mobile Detachment Armed Police Mobile Six Detachment, currently a mobile brigade and part of the 311 brigade of coastal defense forces, a total of about 6,000 people into three mobile groups, allocation in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang area. The task of mobile back-up and anti-terrorism stability maintenance in the Pearl River Delta and western Guangdong. Second, the use of diversion of the four brigades of the sixth detachments of the armed police mobile about 1,600 people, respectively, assigned to Shanwei, Huizhou, Yangjiang, Heyuan, &quot;that is, Guangdong, Shenzhen and Zhanjiang only 6,000 people garrison (light troops), either all equipped in the Pearl River Delta, otherwise, it would be used in accordance with the &quot;four cities in eastern Guangdong, 1,600 people, Foshan, Zhanjiang, about 500 people by the command of the mobile combat group of 4,000 people in four groups&quot; divided. The PLA calls 6,000 people &quot;a sizable force&quot;, which is a bluff.</p> <p>4、The meeting mentioned that &quot;the 208 Coastal defense 311 Brigade has two coastal defense groups, with about 500 people carrying light weapons, which are assigned to the six important military targets of Foshan and Zhanjiang. The defense tasks are heavy and their own defense forces are weak, and should be strengthened.&quot; , which means that the two coastal defense battalions of the 311 Brigade of Haiphong are responsible for the stability maintenance work in Foshan and Zhanjiang. They are composed of 500 soldiers equipped with light weapons. The defense force of only 500 people deployed in the two areas with populations exceeding 10 million is insignificant. The light weapons these 500 soldiers are equipped with are not firearms, but cold weapons such as sticks and steel forks. This is the CCP's psychological warfare against the Chinese. The CCP wants to use extremely scarce troops to disguise a powerful army, in order to intimidate the Chinese, make the Chinese fear and give up resistance. When the Chinese learn the truth through Lude Media, they will have the confidence to resist the CCP regime.</p> <hr> <p>Since Lude Media's intelligence forces have penetrated the highest levels of the Chinese Communist regime, the secret strategies of the Communist Party will be exposed at any time. The world will know the details of their schemes.</p> <p>The high value of the recording of this meeting is that, first, it exposes the secret situation of the PLA's transition from peacetime to wartime and strategic mobilization; second, the strategic mobilization meeting has exposed classified data, location, and deployment.</p> <p>The Chinese Communist Party is doing its best to deceive Chinese people to voluntarily go to the front line and take bullets for the Party and die for their country, while they hide themselves in the safety net called &quot; combat command center&quot;.
Everything the CCP did was to deceive the Chinese people and sacrifice the lives of Chinese to achieve their welfare.
The Chinese Communist Party can directly grab the Chinese people's production and living materials as war resources in order to prevent the cut-off of supply chains and raw materials in wartime.
The CCP's means of controlling social movement during wartime is the &quot; compulsory zero-tolerance&quot; approach adopted since 2020, in order to achieve grid-based control of the Chinese people.
Even in wartime, the CCP does not dare to arm its stabilization forces with guns, and only allows them to use cold weapons such as sticks and steel forks.
The CCP's wartime stability maintenance practice is to deceive the Chinese by using a deception to make Chinese people think that there are many troops to prevent large-scale social disorders, but in fact there are only a limited number of thousands of people, which is a tiny amount for Guangdong, a province with a population of over 100 million.
The Chinese people have been deceived and enslaved for too long . Wake up, Chinese people, our awakening will be the time that the Chinese Communist Party's regime falls apart.</p> <p>According to Lude Media 's judgment: (1) ordinary Chinese are please to stay away from the war and not to become the victims of the CCP; (2) the meeting exposed the inferiority of the PLA's combat skills and that the PLA is definitely going to lose in future wars; (3) the CCP's regime is at the terminal stage, revealing that the CCP's mobilization ability has been weakened to a certain extent and it is extremely difficult to mobilize even a few hundred people for war, and it does not dare to arm the stabilization army with guns; (4) the CCP is terribly frightened that the situation in Hong Kong and Macau will affect Guangdong Province if it gets out of hand. (4) The CCP is very scared of &quot;chaos in China with Hong Kong&quot;, in other words, if the situation in Hong Kong and Macau goes out of control, it will lead to instability affecting Guangdong Province, and the CCP is also very scared that Zhanjiang will run out of control, because Zhanjiang is closer to Vietnam, and Lude Media is  calling for immediate action by China's omnipresent fighting forces.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
