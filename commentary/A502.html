The possession of these rights is what distinguishes a citizen from a resident, and before the rights of citizenship, each citizen, all are equal.</p> <p>It is a matter of course that a state is a political entity on a piece of land, and that a state can legally become several states independently, and that several states can legally merge into one state.</p> <p>It is clear that the citizen is the owner of power, and the government is a delegate of power, a representative organization created by the citizen's authority; the authority of the government is under the rights of the individual and the rights of the citizen; the work of the government is to provide services to the people as requested by the citizen, and the results of the work are subject to the citizen's supervision; the government employees are rewarded for the services they provide.</p> <p>Therefore, it can be determined that</p> <ol><li>laws enacted by the authority of the citizens shall not conflict with the rights of individuals and citizens, and any such conflict shall be deemed null and void</li> <li>where laws are reviewed and put into effect by citizens, everyone is required to abide by them, and it is more important for the government to abide by them than for individuals to do so</li> <li>that the people create wealth through their labor and support the government by paying taxes.</li></ol> <p>However, in the ancient land of China, since ancient times, these rights have either been ignored and forgotten by the people or granted to the government by default. If the government that gets the power can guarantee the people's security, recovering these mandates is not urgent and important; if the government not only fails to guarantee the people's security, but increasingly harshly harms the people, recovering these mandates is not only urgent and important, it is the natural thing to do!</p> <p>Here is what I know.</p> <ol><li><p>the right to life is not guaranteed in this land. Power is used to kill people outright, or to protect those who kill, or to force people to commit suicide, or to prevent people from protecting their own lives, ad infinitum.</p></li> <li><p>a land where the right to freedom is not guaranteed. Freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of movement, and freedom of belief are severely curtailed to the point of total deprivation, which is becoming more and more severe.</p></li></ol> <p>In this land, the right to non-removal of organs is desecrated. Whether a person is alive or dead, he or she does not have the right to trade his or her organs, let alone those of others; the price is clearly marked here, and the people are outraged.</p> <p>In this land, the right to pursue happiness is not guaranteed. The inviolability of private property is the basic guarantee for the pursuit of happiness, but here, the law is changed from time to time, and the deprivation of private property is commonplace.</p> <ol start="5"><li><p>The right to be free from fear is not guaranteed in this land. Power is unchecked and ensures that the people remain in fear, unthinkable.</p></li> <li><p>a land where the right to citizen participation is not guaranteed. The people's representatives are all determined, and individuals are arrested for running for office, as witnessed time and again.</p></li></ol> <p>In this land, the exercise of citizens' rights is not guaranteed. When citizens want to exercise their constitutional rights to freedom of speech, freedom of belief, freedom of press and freedom of association, they are often prosecuted and arrested in an arbitrary manner.</p> <ol start="8"><li><p>a land where power is the only thing the government wants. Hong Kong, which already has individual and civil rights, and the protection of international law, the government destroys this jewel, marking that it will never return the people's rights, ironically!</p></li> <li><p>a land where the government is hostile to the people, enslaving them and keeping them in captivity. First Tibet, then Xinjiang, and then the whole country, hostile to humanity, hostile to faith, hostile to facts, hostile to ideas, hostile to records, hostile to shouting. The ironclad evidence is like a mountain!</p></li> <li><p>in this land, the courage is gradually not manifest, the hope is diminishing, the people no longer resist, the shackles are passed from generation to generation, stronger and stronger!</p></li></ol> <p>It does not take courage to make a declaration of rights recovery, nor does it deserve glory, for absolutely legitimate reasons. Today, I solemnly swear by the rights and welfare of future generations, and prove by my actions that the following declaration is not false.</p> <ol><li>that no authorization shall be deemed to have been obtained from me without my active authorization.</li> <li>that no authorization obtained without my free will shall be deemed to have been given by me</li> <li>that any decision and action taken by a regime that has not been authorized by me, in claiming to make any decision and action on my behalf, is not a decision and action on my behalf</li> <li>that when my right to freedom is violated, I shall inform the other party that my right has been violated, and I regard such notification as resistance</li> <li>that no one shall have access to my organs, even if I am dead, unless I have an authorization to donate them during my lifetime</li> <li>when I and my family are faced with unlawful fear, I regard all means of response as justified</li> <li>when I and my family are faced with an unlawful threat to my life, I will resist to the maximum extent possible at the cost of my life</li> <li>when I face a collective threat to my community, I will be the first to muster the courage to never sit idly by and will do something about it.</li></ol> <p>The times are not chosen, the land is as old as time; if I do not make changes, there is no hope for the happiness of my children and grandchildren. If I am killed, please spread my courage, and with it my hope, so that it echoes!</p> <p>If this is the last cry, I will shout out: we are the people and shall enjoy all the glory of the earth!</p> <p>
