Such as &quot;the siege of Changchun&quot;. Mao once said the siege of the city is one of the most important methods to annihilate enemies.</p><h2 id="encircling-a-position-point-to-annihilate-the-enemy-s-reinforcement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#encircling-a-position-point-to-annihilate-the-enemy-s-reinforcement" aria-hidden="true">#</a> encircling a position/point to annihilate the enemy\u2019s reinforcement</h2><p>The reason for &quot;encircling a position/point to annihilate the enemy\u2019s reinforcement&quot;</p><p>A. In moral level The hope of breaking through the lock down to Taiwan is the US military. If Xi chooses the strategy of &quot;encircling a position/point to annihilate the enemy\u2019s reinforcement&quot;, and then the US military refuses to participate in or just confront the PLA without fighting, the belief of people in Taiwan can be easily collapsed. And it will be easier for Xi to occupy an intact Taiwan without causing too much blood and injury.</p><p>B. In military level If it\u2019s inevitable to fight against the US military, there will be greater advantages to actively start the war than passively reacting to it. Instead of using the strategy of &quot;landing on two front lines against Taiwan and letting the US military wait for an opportunity to win&quot;, it\u2019s better to lockdown Taiwan and focus core military forces on fighting against the reinforcement of the US military. (this is meaning of \u201Cdeployment of elite forces in advance\u201D, \u201C\u62D2\u6B62\u6B7C\u654C\u201D and \u201Cparticipation in support of front-line operations\u201D in Guangdong recording) Once the PLA wins the war or defeats the US military, Taiwan will surrender actively.</p><p>C. In Security level Because Taiwan Strait is relatively close to the mainland of China, once the war happens, it\u2019s easy to cause accidental affect to coastal cities Pushing the battlefield between the first island chain and the second island chain forward by 800 to 1500 kilometers can greatly improve the protection of coastal cities. And Xi will gain 5 times the strategic depth.</p><img src="https://sat02pap002files.storage.live.com/y4mE7ow4nyP431DOJWWXIxiH3C13DJHQZivnKxlicARFLPiRN2oST48DE-QAem37fOkXa9VK-KmBIP839ma4CA6n_igacnlArp7-ZcLDAVZPHvx1e31MOEho6lKNbMk25InCgFFL4Ltw5iKTtnphoI_zzSUmTB1LBulIAfGsNeLS1snPPektN6vcL214iCk-5iB?width=649&amp;height=1119&amp;cropmode=none" width="649" height="1119"><p>D. Lessons from Russia If the United States copies the &quot;Ukrainian model&quot; and transfers weapons and equipment through the east coast of Taiwan, Taiwan will become a long-lasting battlefield and Xi will lose the chance to use the strategy of &quot;encircling a position/point to annihilate the enemy\u2019s reinforcement &quot;. The lessons of Russia&#39;s blitzkrieg in Ukraine told Xi that the surround and confrontation must be taken before the war starts, which means priority to block down Taiwan for a period of time and then decide whether to start the war. If Xi doesn&#39;t even have the ability to lock down Taiwan, he will not take caustic action. The amphibious landing exercise of the 71st Group Army in the early this month was actually a trick and could be ignored.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Conclusion</h2><p>Surround Taiwan, confrontation and encircle a position/point (Taiwan) to annihilate the enemy\u2019s reinforcement (US military) is the core aim and strategy of \u201Cmobilizing the whole people\u201D and \u201Cstrategic victory\u201D in Guangdong extended meeting of the Standing Committee</p>',27),r=[o];function s(c,h){return t(),i("div",null,r)}var d=e(a,[["render",s],["__file","005.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
