Over!</p><p>We&#39;ve just had the command and control center conveys and designates the mission. Next, we&#39;ll have Governor Wang Weizhong to organize the study of mobilization planning tasks. Now, let&#39;s go through the task of mobilization planning. First, we&#39;ll have the National Defense Mobilization Center to brief.</p><p>Wang Weizhong ( Deputy Secretary of Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, Governor) :</p><p>During these two days, the Vice Governor (Guang Dong province) Zhizhong Wang(\u738B\u5FD7\u4E2D) coordinated the mobilization tasks in the two strategic directions of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, analyzed and compared the potential resources of our province (Guang Dong province), and revised the mobilization plan.</p><p>The related report is as follows:</p><p>First, mobilization guidance, follow the mobilization guidance of focusing on the Taiwan Strait as highest priority, coordinating the Two Seas <em>(the East China Sea and the South China Sea)</em> , Integrating the system, joining and Gathering Recasting , Gathering Energy and Strength, and Situational-oriented mobilization. Coordinate the deployment of the province&#39;s potential resources, deeply dig into the mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities, priority is given to ensuring the victory of the decisive battle in the Taiwan Strait, coordinate the safeguarding of the South China Sea side support, and comprehensively respond to local <em>(\u201Clocal\u201D indicated the Guang Dong)</em> and Hong Kong and Macao chain reactions.</p><p>Second, creating a three-zone deployment of mobilization.</p><p>1, is to arrange the frontline mobilization, the frontier position of the strategic decision-making composed by four cities in eastern Guangdong <em>(\u7CA4\u4E1C\u56DB\u5E02)</em>.</p><p>2, The side support area of the South China Sea direction is established by the form the key response to strategic decision-making. This response to strategic decision-making is composed of seven cities in western Guangdong and northern Guangdong.</p><p>3, the core mobilization of \u200B\u200Bmobile support is established by the important support for strategic decision-making composed of the main deployment sites of six major cities in the Pearl River Delta and 74th Group Army constitute.</p><p>Third, task distribution, focuses on completing the following five main tasks.</p><p>1\u3001Recruitment\uFF1Ato recruit paramilitaries and related personnel. The recruitment follows the principle of corresponding the professional requirements, balancing the burden, leaving redundancy, ensuring approval, and taking into account the continuity\uFF08this may indicate no focusing recruitment, to make sure the recruitment is sustainable in the long term development \uFF09, reservists are recruited according to their professions, retired soldiers are mainly recruited from the rear security area, and specially recruited talents are mainly recruited from the Pearl River Delta industrial cluster.</p><p>2\u3001Maritime support mobilization. Including ro-ro ships, fishing vessels, rescue vessels, multi-purpose vessels, and other vessels/boats. The mobilization is majorly from provincial industry systems and 14 mobilization coastal cities.</p><p>3\u3001The Resource mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities. Including special reconnaissance, oceanic early waring, cyberspace, underwater detection, unmanned combat resources and other combat in novel-domains and capabilities, this discovery and mobilization is majorly basic on the core area of \u200B\u200Bthe Pearl River Delta.</p><p>4\u3001Mobilization of equipment and materials. Including dockyards, grain depots, blood stations, oil depots, gas stations, etc., following the principle of integration of sections and blocks, the mobilization is majorly carried out from economic centers at all levels, material support bases, and regional comprehensive support centers.</p><p>5\u3001Mobilization of ground defense forces,due to the shortage of local military and police forces in support of the war front, including militia detachment and national defense mobilization professional teams. Mobilize in local place, use it in local place. This mobilization is mainly conducted by each city that combines their tasks.</p><p>Among the mobilization tasks given all 239 above tasks in 8 categories of the step-by-step mobilization plan have been implemented.</p><p>The newly added 43 tasks in 3 categories, take the action of cross-regional coordination and deployment of emergency expansion and formation, and organization of field expansion and supplementation. Overall, the task can be completed.</p><p>However, in the implementation of the mobilization task, the following two aspects also need to be highly focused on.</p><p>the recruitment of soldiers issue. The recruitment of 15,500 soldiers need to be completed in one month, especially the first batch of 2,500 soldiers. The time to achieve this recruitment is very urgent.</p><p>2\u3001the mobilization of maritime support, mainly due to the heavy tasks of all kinds of ship-weaponization, the high-quality rate of crew members during wartime, there are still some compatible issues about adaptation rate <em>(\u9002\u914D\u7387)</em> of equipments. The report is complete.</p><p>Just now, the National Defense Mobilization Center reported on the implementation of the mobilization task. The task is basically clear, and the key is whether it can be implemented. These two high focus issues are particularly important. Any additional comments?</p><p>I will make an additional statement on coordinating the implementation of strategic resources at the national level.</p><p>The National Mobilization Committee has made it clear that the national strategic resources within Guangdong Province will be given an unified order of recruitment by the National Mobilization Committee and the Strategic Direction Coordination Group <em>(\u6218\u7565\u65B9\u5411\u534F\u8C03\u7EC4)</em>. To clear the mobilization task.</p><p>Our province is responsible for coordinating and implementing the work of gathering, grouping, refitting, transporting and handing over works/tasks. This task has many coordination links and a long implementation chains.</p><p>For example, 10,000-ton ro-ro ships, it has to cooperate with the national shipping authority to recruit and weaponized plans, and at the same time need to organize the formation of on-board militia for each ship, equip ships with weapons, and organize transportation and handover.</p><p>We must stand at the overall picture, and earnestly complete this task. It is suggested that in accordance with the principles of unified decision-making, graded implementation, and industry-specific guidance, the relevant provincial industry departments guide each city, and each of you must concentrate on the implementation of the above tasks .</p><p>In addition, in recent years, combat in novel-domains and capabilities of our province has developed rapidly.I see that there are many needs in the tasks proposed by the troops, and we should also pay attention to the implementation of this part of the tasks.</p><p>Any additional comments?</p><p>If there is no doubt, then we will focus on the three main tasks about recruiting soldiers, mobilizing maritime support, and mobilizing the forces of the combat in novel-domains and capabilities.</p><p>First of all, let\u2019s discuss the issue of recruiting soldiers, please make a speech.</p><p>Commander, let me make a speech about the issue of urgency of recruitment from three aspects:</p><p>First\uFF0CIn order to recruit soldiers as soon as possible first time quickly, directly with the help of big data technology to lock the right candidate, and then handed over to the grassroots organization staff to complete the recruitment.<em>(The big data of CCP has personal data of all people and can quickly screen suitable personnel for the type of soldiers)</em></p><p>Second, Immediate physical examination and investigation of political affiliation. Simultaneously organize physical examinations and historical investigations of political affiliation, and determine the recruiting target at the first time.</p><p>Third, assemble and handover quickly. Coordinate with the military transportation department, quickly organize and arrange transportation plans, assemble and deliver personnel before the time nodes.</p><p>It is suggested that Health and Public Security Departments should assist in opening up special channels for the off-site physical examinations and investigation of political affiliation across the province to provide the on-the-spot services for recruitment.</p><p>Deputy Secretary, please make sure to accomplish the off-site physical examinations and investigations of political affiliation across the province.</p><p>Ok! I\u2019d like to add up!</p><p>We have feedback that since we\u2019re going to start a war now, some people are eager to participate, while others are afraid, timid, and escaping from the war!</p><p>I suggest we should strengthen the effort of propaganda. All mainstream media should propagate our determination of strategic victory to conquer Taiwan, which relates to the reunification of China and the great rejuvenation of the nation! And we should also stimulate the people\u2019s determination to fight against our enemies together in Guangdong province.</p><p>On the other hand, we should increase the efforts of soldier assistance! Regarding the new recruits, we should solve their problems, regularly comfort them and eliminate their concerns after the recruitment. For their outstanding performances, especially the soldiers who get awards, we should notify their families timely, reward them publicly and treat them well.</p><p>I\u2019d like to add that, besides positive incentives, we must strengthen punishment in accordance with the law! For those who refuse to be recruited, the government should persuade them timely or impose administrative sanctions according to law. Those who are members of CCP, should be punished according to the Party&#39;s discipline. If the circumstances are serious, punish them severely and expose them publicly according to the Criminal Law and Military Service Law.</p><p>End of report!</p><p>Based on existing methods of recruitment, Departments at all levels in Guangdong should set up a Wartime Recruitment Agency. Government departments such as health, public security, education, and veteran service must cooperate fully. Try the best to serve for the recruitment and make greater effort to propaganda. No matter how urgent and difficult the task is, we must complete it in time with high standards.</p><p>Next, let\u2019s discuss the issue of mobilizing maritime support. Please make a speech!</p><p>I\u2019d like to make a speech about ship weaponization.</p><p>The task assigned by the Southern Theater Command is to complete 365 ships weaponization \uFF08include ro-ro ships\uFF09within 45 days. In addition, there are 64 ships occupied by the national departments within our jurisdiction, and 8 ships are literally assigned to our province.</p><p>There are 90 capable ship repair and construction enterprises in the whole province, which can weaponize 113 ships at one time. And 280 ships can be weaponized within this month in total.</p><p>However, considering the distribution of those enterprises, high-quality ship repair and construction sources are mostly integrated in Guangzhou, Yangjiang and Dongguan. The ability to weaponize ships in eastern Guangdong is weak.</p><p>So we suggest three methods to solve.</p><p>First, integrate advantages. By making full use of large repair and construction shipyard in the whole province, integrate those ships of more than 1,000 tons, and then classify and weaponize those ships.</p><p>Second, multi-point distribution. 23 wharfs are selected in coastal cities to quickly weaponize the fishing ship.</p><p>Third, transfer sources. Transfer sources from Guangzhou, Jiangmen and Zhanjiang to strengthen the ability of weaponization in eastern GuangDong.</p><p>I suggest, coordinating with the Agricultural and Rural Economic Organization, the relevant task is headed by us and then we impose it on all cities.</p><p>You undertake and implement this task. You should also foresee all kinds of complicated situations, especially to strengthen the defense of shipyards and ensure the purchase and supply of raw materials and accessories. Think carefully in all aspects and make sure to implement this task in time.</p><p>It was mentioned that the cadres and equipment deployment should be strengthened in the mobilization task proposal. What do you think about it?</p><p>Commander! Regarding the fleet formation and the deployment of personnel and equipment, we prepare to do as follow.</p><p>First, strengthen the deployment of cadres on ships. According to the different aim and usage of support tasks, cadres are divided into 3 brigades, 45 squadrons, and 135 divisions. There are 231 cadres on board, including 3 regimental cadres, 45 battalion cadres and 183 other army cadres.</p><p>Second, optimize the deployment of militia on ships. Take a mix mode based on crew, veterans and equipment. The delivery ship mainly focuses on defense, medical staff and correspondent are also included in. 10,000-ton ships are equipped with a Platoon, 1,000-ton and 100-ton ships are equipped with a Squad. Each group of militia is equipped with defense forces and the equipment operators.</p><p>Third, install all kinds of high-tech equipment to meet the demands of the latest tasks of the maritime militia. More than 2,000 sets of high-tech unmanned equipment are installed for the militia fighting, such as radar and sonar.</p><p>End of report</p><p>Comrade Jun Zou! The National Defense Mobilization Center demanded 231 cadres on board. Can we meet these demands?</p><p>According to the tasks and preparation of each department, we unified deployment of core cadres. Now, there are still a lack of 68 military cadres and 91 civil cadres. It is suggested to solve it in three ways as follow:</p><p>First, deploy cadres from inland military sub-commands. Especially those 57 regimental cadres, who ever participated in major maritime rights protection actions, should be added in according to the law.</p><p>Second, select civil cadres. Cadres from the fishery, fishery administration system and grassroots-level department, who have rich experience in maritime rights protection, should be selected as a commander.</p><p>Third, apply to the superior for dispatch. Apply to the National Defense Mobilization Department for urgently dispatching some cadres with rich experience in maritime rights protection.</p><p>End of report</p><p>Good job! Such mobilization at sea is very important! Apart from what you just mentioned, the issue of mobilization at sea must be resolved!</p><p>The National Defense Mobilization Center and the political work department should reasonably allocate manpowers and core team, and the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee should cooperate with the relevant work.</p><p>Next, we will continue to study the combat in novel-domains and capabilities. Let me ask a question. I mentioned that the ship needs to add more than 2,000 pieces of high-tech equipment. How is everything prepared?</p><p>With more than 2,000 pieces of high-tech equipment, 480 drones and 70 unmanned boats are currently in place. Need to catch up to switch control.</p><p>Regarding drones, the mobilization center of our province, Shenzhen Alltech and Dongguan Zhongchuang have a monthly production capacity of 80 units. It is recommended to urgently mobilize 9 companies with this production capacity, including Shenzhen Smart Drone UVA, Dongguan Zhongchuang Intelligent Equipment and Guangzhou Hopong Helicopter Remote, to cooperate and produce.</p><p>Regarding unmanned boats, the unmanned boat mobilization center of our province, Zhuhai Yunzhou, and Jianglong Shipbuilding have a monthly production capacity of 90 units. Both tasks can be completed on time. (Company&#39;s name to be verified)</p><p>However, considering it may face the impact of laborers leaving and supply chain disruption. It is recommended to take the following countermeasures:</p><p>First, organize designated enterprises, take measures to hold the workers staying in position, and transfer personnel of the same type from other enterprises to make up for the task gap of designated enterprises.</p><p>Second, adopt the method of purchasing from other provinces and fixed-point production, to ensure the supply of raw materials.</p><p>Third, ask the transportation department, take measures such as opening up green channels to ensure all kinds of transportation. That&#39;s all.</p><p>Our province has massive networks and network technology advantages.</p><p>According to the needs of mobilization tasks, how to choose the best among the best, and how to tap the potential energy of the network hidden in the civil field to support operations? Any thoughts?</p><p>The superiors asked us to mobilize. We have 15 teams, there is currently a deficit of 6 teams in total 60 people, and 32 network experts in the industrial control system industry. Our opinion is to mobilize key high-tech companies such as QiAnXin, Huawei, Tencent to increase the corresponding allocation and meet the needs of the military.</p><p>On the other hand, from China Southern Power Grid Guangdong Company, Guangzhou Metro Group and other large enterprises, an appropriate number of network experts in the industrial control system industry will be recruited.</p><p>Meanwhile, the three major network industry associations such as the Computer Network Security Association, the Provincial Network Security Association, and the Provincial Threat Intelligence Data Alliance will further help with their potential.</p><p>In addition, we will work with relevant industry authorities to strengthen the monitoring, early warning and security protection of information systems in the financial, energy, electricity, transportation industries and information systems. Ensure that the security grid defense line in key areas won\u2019t be penetrated.</p><p>We must hurry up the mobilization of network support and complete the task with quality and quantity. The combat in novel-domains and capabilities also includes space support, our province has strong commercial satellite production and assembly capabilities, and Guangzhou has a full commercial aerospace industry chain.</p><p>Shenzhen can find all satellite supporting companies. Can we take the initiative to use our advantages in this area to contribute to the war?</p><p>Commander, we currently rely on Zhuhai Obit, Shenzhen Dongfanghong, Foshan Deya and Jihua Laboratory, four satellite teams, a total of 16 low-orbit satellites, with global remote sensing 0.5 to 10 meters ultra-high optical resolution imaging capabilities.</p><p>Although these resources are directly deployed by the military, the enterprises where the resources are located belong to our province, and we have a duty to ensure that these forces play a good role.</p><p>According to the coordination and docking with the troops in the early stage, I feel that there are two aspects that need to be paid attention to.</p><p>First, take the initiative to serve the enterprises in the front, and the competent industry departments will send special personnel to the enterprises to provide services, stabilize the backbone technical personnel, and support the key bone network facilities. Make sure that the satellite data is transmitted back.</p><p>Second, do a good job in the safety protection of satellite receiving stations. At present, there are four ground receiving stations in our province, including one in Zhuhai, one in Mohe in Heilongjiang, one in Wusu in Xinjiang, and one in Gaomi in Shandong. For the Zhuhai military-civilian joint command in our province, should make it an important defense target, join the joint defense system.</p><p>If it is distributed in other provinces, it is recommended to notify relevant provinces to pay attention through the strategic coordination group.</p><p>In addition, it is necessary to make preparations for emergency production during wartime, master the commercial satellite industry chain and supply chain, and work with related enterprises to do a good job in the reserve of production materials and the prefabrication of production lines.</p><p>Once necessary, relevant departments will quickly respond and actively coordinate, shorten the approval cycle, speed up the emergency production of commercial satellites, and increase the resources of high-tech enterprises in our province.</p><p>That&#39;s all.</p><p>Regarding the mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities, the relevant departments should follow the functional division of labor and do a good job in the implementation of tasks. Let&#39;s finish this study here.</p><p>Commander Zhou He, what&#39;s your opinion?</p><p>Zhou He: \uFF08Major General of the People&#39;s Liberation Army, Commander of the Guangdong Military Region\uFF09</p><p>In principle, I agree with the National Defense Mobilization Center&#39;s mobilization task and implementation task proposal, agree with other comrades&#39; opinions, and have no other supplementary opinions.</p><p>What about you, Political Commissar Wang Shouxin?</p><p>Wang Shouxin: ( Member of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, Political Commissar of the Provincial Military Region )</p><p>I would like to add a comment on overseas mobilization.</p><p>Overseas mobilization is an important support for the strategic victory against Taiwan. It is necessary to give full play to the advantages of our province having a large number of overseas Chinese immigrants from our province, many state-owned and private enterprises going abroad, and many economic and trade cooperation with countries along the Belt and Road.</p><p>Adopt the method of covering the army with the people and supporting the army with the people, sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, and mobilizing the purchase of high-end chips, precision machinery, special materials and other materials that are in short supply in China. As well as large quantities of strategic reserve materials such as oil, grain, minerals, etc., to solve the dilemma of the Western Alliance&#39;s pursuit and interception of strategic materials in the wartime, vigorously mobilize overseas Chinese immigrants and groups, actively participate in supporting and safeguarding our military operations, and increase the introduction of special professionals. Strive to make sure the global resources are available to us and ensure that foreign aid is effective and efficient.</p><p>Just now, the National Defense Mobilization Center reported on the implementation of the mobilization task. All units and departments should follow a clear division of responsibilities and implement them without compromise. Everyone discussed issues related to the recruitment of soldiers and the new recruits in the new domain, and it was very good.</p><p>Political commissar Wang Shouxin put forward very good opinions on overseas mobilization, and I agree with him. Next, I would like to emphasize three points:</p><p>First, we must strengthen the awareness of the overall situation, gather our strength to return to unity, and contain strategic decisive victory. It is a battle of reunification, a battle of revival, which can only be successful but not failure. Order consciousness, resolutely implement, all energy, focus on the war, all work serves the war, all resources are tilted to the war, and contribute to the realization of the complete reunification of the motherland and the great rejuvenation of the nation.</p><p>Second, we exploit our advantages and strength integrally, fully ensure to win (the war/combat). From the forefront of reform to the front line of aid, fully exploit the economic advance, largely mobilize resources with in the province and the overseas\u2019, make the full use of the maritime potential, effectively support the combat operations of the troops, fully exploit to the advantages of the organization (communist ideology established organizations and systems), fully release the potential of new areas and new systems \uFF08and combat in novel-domains and capabilities \uFF09, and effectively improve The combat effectiveness of the troops, fully exploit to the advantages of talents of individuals, gather think tanks in various fields to provide intellectual support for the strategic victory. (By doing all of these), this will expand the overall potential resources of our province.</p><p>Third, we must resolutely complete the task and help the decisive battle. The decisive victory at all levels must be based on the most difficult and complex situations, and be fully prepared. The main leaders must stand in the front, and the front line must be supported. All departments must cooperate closely and efficiently meet the needs.</p><p>We must go all out to implement it, to ensure that the recruited troops and mobilized materials will be put into the front line continuously and normally. The plan of mobilization task is done.</p><p>Next, please let Commander Zhou</p><p>Organize research and planning, ground defense combat missions</p><h2 id="record-part-iv" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#record-part-iv" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Record_Part_IV</h2><p>Zhou He: Comrades!</p><p>Next, we will study the determination of directional ground defense operations. First, the command and control center will report the decision-making recommendations.</p><p>Commander! According to the order of the Eastern and Southern Theater Command, the ground defense operations in our province need to be organized and implemented in two situations:</p><p>The first is to participate in ground defense operations in the four cities in eastern Guangdong. Under the unified command of the Eastern Theater Command, the Guangdong Armed Police Corps. The command post was dispatched to lead the organization with 7,000 local militiamen.</p><p>The second is to take the lead in organizing ground defense operations in 17 cities other than eastern Guangdong, and the joint military-civilian command will take the lead in organizing them.</p><p>The distribution forces include: the Guangdong Armed Police Corps (excluding the four cities in eastern Guangdong), the sixth detachment of the Armed Police Second Mobile Corps, a mobile brigade and Coast Guard 311 Brigade, and the second militia battalion with a total of about 26,000 people.</p><p>According to the plan, ground defense operations around 17 cities.</p><p>Among the recommendations are the following:</p><p>1\u3001Guidance on defense Resolutely implement the joint command center of the theater, and adhere to the combat guidance of defense before attacking, regional joint defense, comprehensive deployment and control, elite troops, combination of defense and countermeasures, and focus on protection. Strictly organize the defense of important targets in the jurisdiction, coastal guided maneuver defense, and social stability and chaos, protest the US counterattack, maintain the security of important targets, and maintain social stability. With the overall security and stability of the jurisdiction, it can effectively support the strategic decision-making against Taiwan.</p><p>Second, the focus of defense</p><p>According to the theater command and our province&#39;s plan, the main defense directions are determined as:</p><p>Defense of Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen and Huizhou</p><p>The key defense areas are:</p><p>Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, Yangjiang area</p><p>Important defense targets include important military targets such as the theater joint operations command center and maritime operations sub-center, as well as important civilian targets such as the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and the South China Power Grid. At the same time, we must also concentrate on effectively preventing and reducing the risk of resource cut-off and industrial breakdowns,and make more and more efforts to mobilize and counter-mobilize. Powerfully mobilize domestic and overseas people, and ensure the security of supply of important strategic materials.</p><p>Three about defense measures</p><p>According to the plan, taking the city as a unit and according to the administrative divisions, 17 defense divisions are compiled, as well as the coastal control group, the network information protection group, the mobile combat area and the logistics support team.</p><p>Create a land-shore connection, point-to-surface integration, flexible and defensive measures that have both defense and war. Among them, 17 cities and 17 defense divisions are composed of various militiamen, public security, emergency forces, and municipal armed police internal security detachments.</p><p>The three executive detachments directly under the PAP (Armed Police Force) are assigned to the Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen defense divisions on the spot. The network information protection group and target security team remain unchanged according to the plan.</p><p>Regarding the use of other attachments, we have two options.</p><p>First, concentrated use of the Armed Police Guangzhou Corps Mobile Detachment Six Armed Police Mobile Detachments, now a mobile brigade and part of the Coast Guard 311 Brigade, a total of about 6,000 people are organized into three mobile groups, deployed in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Zhanjiang. Responsible for mobile support and counter-terrorism and stability maintenance tasks in the Pearl River Delta and western Guangdong.</p><p>Second, decentralized use four brigades of the Sixth Armed Police Mobile Detachment, with about 1,600 people, were assigned to Shanwei, Huizhou, Yangjiang and Heyuan respectively.</p><p>The Coast Guard 311 Brigade&#39;s two coastal defense groups, with about 500 people carrying light weapons, were assigned to the six important military targets of Foshan and Zhanjiang. The defense tasks were heavier, and their own defense forces were weak and should be strengthened.</p><p>Third, the other subordinate forces of nearly 4,000 people, under the control of the headquarters, are organized into mobile combat groups, with four sub-groups, each sub-group is responsible for the mobile defense of an area, targeting the exit of the military and the large-scale riots in the Pearl River Delta.</p><p>Fourth, with regard to defense command, relying on the provincial, municipal, and county-level military-civilian joint command organizations, the headquarters establishes a synergistic relationship with the Guangzhou coastal defense cluster, the Nanning air combat cluster, and the large-area combat maneuver support combat cluster within its jurisdiction, as well as relevant important target units.</p><p>Fifth, the time limit for completing the preparations. It is recommended that all preparations be completed before 12:00 on May 9, 6 hours earlier than the time specified by the theater.</p><p>The report is complete!</p><p>Is there anything else to add to the charge center?</p><p>I will add a report!</p><p>When studying the defense operation plan, we mainly grasp three principles.</p><p>First, adhere to the overall joint defense, give full play to the joint efforts of the party, government, army, police and people, and waging a war with all the people through joint prevention and control.</p><p>Second, adhere to flexible arrangements, and on the basis of defending points and controlling surfaces, master capable forces at all levels to implement mobile support.</p><p>Third, adhere to the bottom-line thinking, fully anticipate that our key targets will be attacked by the enemy, and emergencies such as turmoil in megacities, and deploy forces to properly respond.</p><p>Regarding the use of attached power, two schemes are proposed:</p><p>First, it mainly focuses on maintaining stability and controlling chaos, especially for large-scale riots that may occur in the two megacities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and the concentrated use of armed police mobile forces can quickly respond to emergencies and effectively maintain social stability.</p><p>Second, it mainly focuses on the defense of important targets, deploys some of the elite forces to the above configuration, and deploys them in advance to improve the key guarding and quick counter strike capabilities of the defense divisions.</p><p>Once it is estimated that there will be riots in the Pearl River Delta region, the four mobile combat groups can quickly gather to respond.</p><p>We prefer the second case.</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for the two programs proposed by the accusation center?</p><p>I am inclined to the first case.</p><p>The reason is that the population-intensive industries in the Pearl River Delta are concentrated, and more than 80% of the resources in novel-domains and capabilities are concentrated in this area. It can be said that if the Pearl River Delta is stabilized, Guangdong will be stabilized. Once the Pearl River Delta is in chaos, it will seriously affect the implementation of the mobilization task. and sustained mobilization. Therefore, the defense focus should be placed on the Pearl River Delta region.</p><p>The report is complete!</p><p>Commander, I prefer the second case.</p><p>Based on two considerations.</p><p>First, from the perspective of combat objectives, the core of defense operations is the defense target. Where there are many targets and where the targets are important, troops will be allocated where they are. Important targets such as airports, ports, combat positions, and nuclear power plants in the theater must be deployed with elite troops.</p><p>Second, from the perspective of the threat of the enemy situation, it is mainly special warfare special attack and latent special destruction. In the second case, some of the elite forces were assigned to the defense division, and some of the elite forces were supported in the area, which was conducive to the realization of comprehensive control and the need for elite troops.</p><p>The report is complete!</p><p>Commander, I am leaning towards the first case!</p><p>There are two reasons</p><p>First, it is convenient to concentrate superior forces for mobile support, and the command headquarters can directly grasp more superior forces, which is convenient for dealing with the uncertainty of defense operations.</p><p>Second, it is convenient to maintain social stability in megacities. In Guangzhou and Shenzhen, a certain scale of troops are stationed together to facilitate the formation of deterrence, and they can be dealt with quickly in case of situations.</p><p>The report is complete!</p><p>Do other comrades have any additional comments?</p><p>Okay, everyone has talked a lot about this issue. Does the command and control center have any difficulty in defending nuclear power plant equipment and high-risk sensitive targets?</p><p>commander! There are four nuclear power plants in Daya Bay, Ling&#39;ao, Taishan and Yangjiang in our province, which are respectively under the responsibility of Shenzhen, Jiangmen and Yangjiang security divisions.</p><p>The difficulty for nuclear power plants is how to rescue them in the event of a leak. We consider that, in general, rescue operations are organized on-site and off-site separately. On-site is organized by the self-sustaining force of the nuclear power plant, and various defense divisions are responsible for the off-site. If necessary, ask the relevant national professional rescue forces for support.</p><p>The report is complete!</p><p>Besides the cities, what other nuclear defense forces are there at the provincial level?</p><p>commander! There are also radiation environment monitoring, nuclear and biochemical support, and biochemical medical testing in the Guangzhou area, but the overall scale is small.</p><p>Answered!</p><p>Okay, this is the end of the study. Vice Governor Zhizhong, do you have any comments on the defense operations?</p><p>Wang Zhizhong: \uFF08Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province\uFF0CDirector of the Provincial Public Security Department )</p><p>We will organize the public security forces to fully participate, about the Military-civilian joint defense I have no other opinions!</p><p>Okay, what else do you think about the commissar of defense operations?</p><p>Wang Shouxin:</p><p>I have two comments</p><p>First, strengthen the protection of the political field. Judging from the recent local wars, especially the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and the West will try their best to slander and smear me, try to confuse right and wrong, and shake my will to win a just and decisive battle. We must give full play to the legal struggle of public opinion, psychology and the role of the militia team, strengthen the guidance of public opinion and psychological protection, and gather the positive energy of patriotism and support of the army.</p><p>Second, give full play to the advantages of people&#39;s war, fully absorb the experience of epidemic prevention and control in previous years, fully mobilize grass-roots organizations, widely mobilize cadres and the masses, organize military, police and civilian forces, carry out grid management and control, create an atmosphere for the whole people to prepare for war, and improve the people&#39;s endurance to bear war disasters , so that the enemy&#39;s spy has no place to hide.</p><p>Governor, do you have any other comments here?</p><p>Wang Weizhong\uFF1A</p><p>No opinion, please make up your mind commander!</p><p>Just now, the Command and Control Center put forward suggestions for defense operations, and everyone expressed their opinions from different aspects. According to the orders of the Sub-center of the Southern Theater Command and the actual situation of our province, my determination for the defense operations is as follows:</p><p>1\u3001Regarding defense guidance, in principle, I agree with the command and control center&#39;s suggestion. The ground defense operations in the southern theater should basically be supported by land stability to support the main battlefield in the Taiwan Strait. Specifically, our province should grasp two points.</p><p>1\u3001 Ensure the safety of important targets, ensure the stability of the joint combat system, support the Taiwan Strait and deny enemy annihilation operations.</p><p>2\u3001 Maintain social stability, maintain mobilization potential, and provide strong support for the South Wing of Taiwan, with the overall security and stability of the jurisdiction.</p><p>Second, regarding the important defense areas, in addition to Guangzhou, Huizhou, Shenzhen, and Yangjiang, the Zhanjiang area has important targets such as Zhanjiang Port, Suining Airport, and radar stations, which are the key areas in the South China Sea to deny the frontline enemy forces, and they must also be heavily defended.</p><p>Third, with regard to the deployment of defense and the use of active-duty forces.</p><p>In principle, I agree with the second plan. The clear and important goals of the theater are related to the stability of the joint combat system. It is necessary to control the forces and ensure security. While the mobile combat forces are supported by divisions, they must be prepared for the deployment of troops and centralized handling of emergencies.</p><p>In addition, make two adjustments.</p><p>First, the use of nuclear rescue forces. The province&#39;s nuclear rescue forces are limited. On the basis of relying on Shenzhen, Jiangmen, and Yangjiang&#39;s own strengths, we should organize professional forces in the Guangzhou area, compile them into nuclear rescue forces, and coordinate rescue needs in Guangzhou. Implement mobile rescue, and at the same time add nuclear experts to the command center to provide assistance in decision making for rescue operations.</p><p>Second, the use of network protection forces, in principle, the network protection is mainly responsible for the own security team. The provincial network information protection group will provide support, and the support force must be strengthened.</p><p>In addition to the support of the technical support team of the service organization, the preparation of network experts should be added to provide support for the preparation of network security incidents.</p><p>For other content, I agree with the suggestion of the accusation center.</p><p>After the meeting, according to the spirit of the meeting, organize and report our province&#39;s determination to mobilize and fight for defense. Dismissed!</p><p>According to the deployment of the provincial military-civilian joint headquarters, and the military-civilian joint headquarters of each city held a symposium to understand the task, develop intelligence, and coordinate the upper and lower levels to plan synchronously.</p><p>Report to the head, the plenary session is over!</p><h2 id="reviews" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reviews" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reviews</h2><p>This is a recording of a high-level confidential pre-war mobilization meeting between the PLA&#39;s Eastern and Southern Theater Command to the Guangdong Military Region, this kind of classified intelligence that will remain classified for ten years in China. All official media in CCP had no chance to access the content of the meeting. The intelligence that previously revealed by Lude was recounted after listening to recordings similar to this one, include the intelligence of the Wuhan military exercise meeting called &quot;Operation 9.18&quot; and the Xi&#39;an Hemorrhagic fever military exercise meeting, and today is the first time the original recorded information has been played in public. Lude has also listened to all the recorded conversations of Xi Jinping himself and those close to him, and all the evidence indicates that Xi Jinping is a stupid and self-opinionated man. Things that people of ordinary intelligence find insane or unworkable, Xi Jinping is firmly convinced that it can be done by him. Thus the Chinese war preparations revealed in this recording are Xi Jinping&#39;s pre-war mobilization for the coming war. The conference was aimed at the strategic military layout of the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, which are adjacent to Guangdong. Divided into four sections\uFF1A</p><h3 id="reviews-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reviews-part-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reviews Part 1</h3><p>Part 1: Follow the instructions of &quot;Central Military Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China - Guangdong Provincial Party Committee - Southern Theater Command - Guangdong Military Region&quot; to transmit the instruction of the command level-by-level, fully comprehend the spirit and assignment and the issue mobilization command.</p><p>Guangdong Province has already launched full-scale work of &quot;transition from peacetime to wartime&quot; (that is, Guangdong Province is into a state of war), which indicates that the following work will be dominated by wartime conditions. In the Chinese Communist Party system, the war zones are equivalent to the battlefield force system, and the provincial military regions are responsible for mobilizing the local militia before the war, which means mobilizing the resources of the &quot; civilian&quot; in the &quot;military-civilian fusion&quot;. The recording is talking about how to transfer the civilian resources of Guangdong Province into wartime resources.</p><p>1\u3001With &quot; rapidly establish a joint military-civil command party committee &quot;, &quot; initiate the Party - Government - Military - Police and Civilian joint defense and control mechanism, and Wartime Special Supervision System &quot; It means that the Military control has replaced the present peacetime social order.</p><p>2\u3001&quot;Ensure high efficient and effective transition from peacetime to wartime mechanism&quot; designated this meeting as a marker of the full transition from peacetime to the wartime mechanism in Guangdong Province.</p><p>3\u3001Using the experience and practices accumulated in the prevention and control of the Covid-19 in previous years as an initiative for social prevention and control in wartime. Here also mentioned &quot;to adjust the focus of work from grasping economic development to ensure strategic victory&quot; means to enter the state of military control all the lockdown and the restrictions are for the purpose of warfare. Therefore, the previous city lockdown and restrictions under the compulsory \u201Czero-tolerance\u201D strategy was CCP\u2019s smokescreen. Similarly, North Korea&#39;s current prevention and restriction measure due to the outbreak of Covid-19 is also aimed at a full transition from peacetime to a wartime mechanism , a judgment made based on intelligence by Lude Media.</p><p>4\u3001The three aspects of &quot;analyzing and assessing our province&#39;s potential resources and revising and completing the mobilization strategy&quot; mean that the economy of Guangdong Province has entered a wartime state, and when it enters a wartime state, all economic activities are conducted by military directives, and economic and trade activities during the peacetime will become non-functional.</p><p>5\u3001&quot; Regarding the organization and implementation, it is necessary to coordinate economically developed cities and relatively backward areas, general industry fields and major industry fields&quot;, and to explicitly mandate high-tech enterprises to &quot; convert and expand the production&quot;. The &quot;conversion&quot; refers to the shift to missile production, and the &quot;expansion&quot; refers to the large-scale production of missiles in Xi&#39;an and other cities, all of which Lude Media had gained from insider intelligence provided by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, which also mentioned that Russian missiles are produced in China. The mission to convert and expand production now landed on the Guangdong Provincial Military Commission. We have implemented the strategy of giving cheap products to the &quot;prison industries&quot; and diverting high-end products to military supplies.</p><p>6\u3001Emphasizes the conversion of civilian enterprises to military enterprises should be &quot; self-conscious &quot; and voluntary. &quot; Do not spare a battle to crush Taiwan&#39;s independence and the intentions of powerful enemies&quot;, the &quot;powerful enemies&quot; refers to the United States. This implies that the strategic ambitions of the PLA are not limited to Taiwan, but also the United States. The Chinese Communist Party is accelerating its preparations for war, but they will not attack Taiwan by &quot;militarized force&quot; very soon. It will be a war without weapons, it will be a war that is initiated by hidden force among the ordinary people.</p><p>7\u3001Li Xi ,Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, personally confirmed that China is at risk of cutting-off the industrial chain at the meeting, implying that the top leadership of the CCP has already been aware of the complete decoupling of China and the United States.</p><p>8\u3001The meeting mentioned that \u201Cclose to our province\u2019s border with Hong Kong and Macao and long sea defenses, we must carefully guard against enemy invasion and sabotage, prevent the intention of using Hong Kong to disrupt China, to disrupt the launched warfare. The CCP&#39;s sentence of life imprisonment for Mr. Ma (Twitter name: YA YA), a participant in the Chinese &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; movement, is a harsh example of guarding against enemy invasion and sabotage. Moreover, for the purpose of controlling Hong Kong more quickly, the Chinese Communist Party made Li Jiachao, a police officer, the Chief Executive to prevent &quot;using Hong Kong to disrupt China and to disrupt the launched warfare&quot;. These practices are all for China&#39;s stability maintenance and eliminating interference and disruption during the PLA&#39;s attacks on Taiwan and the United States. In China, only Xi Jinping has the authority to declare a state of war and initiate war mobilization. It is obvious that the pre-war mobilization meeting of the Guangdong military region was ordered by Xi Jinping, and that a war state means all of China&#39;s personnel, financial and material resources are to be deployed and spent for war. Therefore, recent events happened in China, such as the evacuation of Chinese companies, restrictions on the entry and exit of Chinese, military recruitment, and restrictions on essential materials for the daily lives of the Chinese are all means of war mobilization. The next war mobilization tactics will include city lockdowns, curfews, and restrictions on population movement in the major war preparation provinces and cities; increased media censorship and even cut off internet access; and take up for &quot;spies&quot; or even anti-war individuals, the entire population has been in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><h3 id="reviews-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reviews-part-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reviews Part 2</h3><p>Part 2: Setting up a joint military-civil command center and combat command post, which will be specifically planned and deployed for the mission of the peace/war transition of the province. The meeting skipped the rehearsal of the startup of the transition from peacetime to wartime.</p><p>1\u3001Guangdong Province has completed the establishment of military-civil command center and ground command units by 18:00 on April 18, 2022. The command structure is organized into the provincial military-civilian joint headquarters, the South China Sea Battle command post, and several special task mobilization command posts. \u201CThe dedicated command posts rely on the relevant military-civil industrial systems to have twelve sommand posts, including civil air defense, logistic mobilization, national economic mobilization, public propaganda, and safeguarding social stability and preventing chaos. \u201CThese words imply that in the future during wartime, the government machinery in the peacetime state will no longer work, and all judicial and administrative powers will be under the local joint military-civil command center. At which time the Chinese will be put into a state of military control.</p><p>2\u3001The conference mentioned \u201Cestablish the command information link from the Joint Command Center of the Military Commission to the Joint Command Center of the theater, as well as to the provincial, municipal and county military joint command institutions; mainly rely on the joint combat command information system of the theater, and integrate the secret information remote delivery system into the joint combat system.\u201D revealing that the communication system of the PLA is still stuck at a very out-dated level that was used during the Sino-Vietnam War in 1979. For which \u201Cthe secret information remote delivery system\u201D refers to the use of people to deliver intelligence. And that integrating these legacy communication systems into the joint combat warfare, means that the PLA\u2019s communication system has to use the internet to deliver intelligence by phone and people. It was because of this out-dated system of intelligence transmission that so much Chinese top-classified intelligence can be captured and delivered to Lude Media.</p><p>3\u3001The conference mentioned that &quot;the link from the Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission to the provincial military district leadership management information mainly relies on the 509+ platform&quot;. &quot;The command communication link from the provincial - city - county and military joint command units, mainly relying on ultra-shortwave and Tiangong-1 satellite phones, to establish mobile communications in motion&quot;, and &quot;the military to local command communication link, relying on the Acer Electronic Government Intranet Confidential Cryptography system interconnection &quot; revealing that the PLA&#39;s Joint Operations Command System appears to be very powerful and impressive, but in fact it is all over-packaged. For example, the &quot;509+ platform&quot; on which the link from the Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission to the leadership of the provincial military districts is based on World War II-era technology; secondly, &quot;relying on ultra-shortwave and Tiangong-1 satellite telephones to establish mobile communications in motion&quot; is the technical support on which the command communication link from the PLA&#39;s provincial - city - county and military command center. Among them, &quot;communication in motion&quot; refers to the ability to communicate in a moving military vehicle; In addition, the &quot;Acer E-Government Intranet Confidential Cryptography System&quot; on which the communication link between the army and local command relies is also very fragile, and will soon be paralyzed after the war. The &quot;quick conference system&quot; used for the Guangdong military district meeting this time is in the civilian standard and of very low-quality, reflecting the outdated standard of the PLA&#39;s communication system and operational command system.The intelligence described in detail the PLA&#39;s operational command system, communications system configuration, and the significantly different generation from the U.S. operational command system, which would give the free world the confidence to defeat the CCP.</p><h3 id="reviews-part-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reviews-part-3" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reviews Part 3</h3><p>Part 3\uFF0CGuangdong Province mission from the Eastern and Southern Theater Command, the National Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office, and the National Mobilization Committee. After the study and assessment, the tasks of Guangdong Province mainly have five parts: to ensure the decisive battle in the Taiwan Strait (victory), be able to conduct extra long-range strike ( the distance strike capability maybe longer than 300 kilometers ),to participate in the unobstructed project in South China Sea, assist Hong Kong and Macao to maintain stability, and maintain the stability of the home front. Wang Weizhong, Guangdong Provincial Governor, in charge of reporting the Guangdong Provincial Defense Mobilization Center\u2019s mobilization instruction, creating a three-zone deployment of mobilization, distributing five tasks (Recruitment, Maritime support mobilization, Resource mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities, Mobilization of equipment and materials, and Mobilization of ground defense forces), and conduct discussions around three key areas: the recruitment of troops, the mobilization of maritime support, and the mobilization of combat in novel-domains and capabilities. In addition to the three key areas of discussion, Huang Shanchun, political commissar of the Guangdong Military Region, also made supplementary comments on overseas mobilization.</p><p>1\u3001The tasks of Guangdong Province come from the Eastern and Southern Theater Commands, the National Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office, and the National Movement Commission:</p><p>First, the eastern and southern theaters have assigned a total of 20 categories and 239 mobilization tasks to the province, mainly 1,358 sub-units of various types with a total of 140,000 troops, 953 ships of various types, and 1,653 units/sets of various unmanned equipment. 20 airports and docks, 6 repair and shipbuilding yards, 14 emergency transfer centers, and other resources such as grain depots, hospitals, blood stations, oil depots, gas stations, etc. This is an order from the PLA Eastern and Southern War Zones to Guangdong Province, which is required to mobilize 140,000 non-active duty persons, to recruit or produce 953 civilian ships, and recruit or produce 1,653 units/set of unmanned equipment within a specified time limit ( including drones and unmanned ships). In addition, 20 airports and wharfs, and 6 repair and shipyards have been recruited. These recruited private enterprises will send military representatives to station there.</p><p>Second, The Defense Mobilization Recruitment Office will recruit new conscrips, retired military personnel, special professionals in total 15,500 people&quot;, the recruitment of refers to the &quot;special professionals people&quot; is to recruit from large technology companies, such as Huawei that are capable of programming, electronics or high-tech engineers, as well as machinists, pliers and other professional technicians.</p><p>Thirdly, the National Mobilization Committee clearly indicates that the potential strategic resources of the country in the region that will be coordinated and implemented in our province mainly include 64 10,000-ton trains/ships and vessel, 38 aircraft, 588 train cars and 19 civil facilities such as airports and houses.</p><p>2\u3001After the assessment, the task of Guangdong Province mainly has five parts: to ensure the decisive battle in the Taiwan Strait (victory), be able to conduct extra long-range strike ( the distance strike capability maybe longer than 300 kilometers ),to participate in the unobstructed project in South China Sea, assist Hong Kong and Macao to maintain stability, and maintain the stability of the home front.</p><p>\uFF081\uFF09Be able to conduct long-range strike ( Extra long distance strike capability, longer than 300 kilometers ), form the new ocean-going forces, to reconnaissance, submarine search, search and rescue outside the first island chain. The countries mentioned in the &quot;guaranteeing the forward deployment of Rocket Forces&quot; include Japan, the Philippines, and other countries. &quot;Ensuring the advanced deployment of the Rocket Force&quot; means that there must be sufficient personnel at sea to fill the attrition of fighters generated when the PLA Rocket Force pushes beyond the first island chain.</p><p>(2) Assist in the task of maintaining stability in Hong Kong and Macau, &quot;organize border control, maintain the security of the livelihood of Hong Kong and Macau, and prevent the enemy from using Hong Kong to disrupt China.&quot; means that Hong Kong and Macao will under the PLA Guangdong Military Region management in a wartime state.</p><p>(3) Among the tasks of maintaining the stability of the home front, &quot;assisting in guarding 61 important military targets and 276 important civilian targets&quot; is to prevent infiltration and sabotage by &quot;secret agents&quot; as defined by the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>3\u3001Regarding recruitment, the Pearl River Delta has some of China&#39;s top talents from all fields, and the PLA needs to mobilize them all. Due to the current time limitations of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government has been able to identify citizens&#39; personal information &quot;through their Big Data technology&quot; and to pinpoint who the PLA wants to recruit by analyzing personal assets, professional skills and qualifications, personal history, and travel patterns. In the meetings of the executive branch, the discussions are all about how to prevent and punish, and how to do whatever it takes to achieve the goal - which is the truly terrorist. The recruiters can be persuaded by repeated visits and intimidation. For those who do not cooperate with the recruitment, the punishment must be increased. China has also established measures to punish citizens who do not want to obey the recruitment process. Li Xi&#39;s suggestion for the conscription work is &quot;there are some people who are enthusiastically enrolled in the war, but there are also people who are afraid of war, timid to fight, and avoid war&quot; so we need more extensive propaganda, and much more powerful support. In addition, a follower added &quot;in addition to positive motivation, but also to intensify the punishment according to the law&quot;, that is, the individual who does not cooperate with the recruitment should meet with greater punishment according to the law. Lude Media keeps telling people to take precautions, and if it is unfortunate to be recruited, it will certainly become a casualty of war. China is not worthy of having its people fight for it. The reason for China&#39;s strictly and tightly controlled citizens leaving the country is to prevent the wastage of highly skilled individuals.</p><p>4\u3001 In maritime support and mobilization, it is mainly to deal with the heavy tasks of various ship projects, the high quality rate of crew members during wartime, and the adaptation rate of equipment. There are still some contradictions.</p><p>(1) Regarding the issue of ship weaponization, \u201CThe task assigned by the Theater Command is to complete the weaponization of 365 ro-ro ships and other types of ships within 45 days. In addition, there are 64 ships occupied at the national level within the jurisdiction, and 8 ships are clearly under the responsibility of our province. There are 90 capable ship repair and construction enterprises in the province, which can organize a total of 113 ships to be weaponized at one time, and 280 ships can be completed within this month.\u201D At present, the PLA intends to take three approaches &quot;First, the concentration of excellence, utilization of the province&#39;s large ship repair and shipbuilding plants to organize more than 1,000-ton transport vessels, adoption of classification and centralized implementation. Second, multi-point distribution, selected 23 docks in coastal cities, multi-point rapid organization of technical fishing vessels weaponization. Third, cross-regional resource integration, selected ship repair work forces from Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Zhanjiang to strengthen the eastern part of Guangdong. The relevant work is recommended to be led by us, the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Economy organization will guide the cities to push forward the implementation.&quot; This piece of intelligence has tremendous military value; the PLA has testified to confirm that civilian docks and private enterprises have been used for military purposes and are no longer civilian, which would qualify them as military targets and allow the U.S. military to take targeted killings. The addition of weaponized vessels include 64 vessels of over 10,000 tons, the others are under 10,000 tons; 23 docks are responsible for weaponize fishing vessels, and the PLA is weaponizing all fishing vessels, which also means that there will be a large number of military weaponized vessels in the eastern part of Guangdong.&quot;strengthen the protection of ship repair facilities&quot; because the PLA believes that as long as they are civilian facilities, the U.S. will not focus on them as military targets. But now that the intelligence has been declassified and the evidence is conclusive, the U.S. military will definitely hit the weaponized civilian facilities mentioned in the meeting, so Lude Media urges workers engaged in ship modifications not to work on weaponized civilian ship, or risk losing their lives, and advises everyone to stay away from war.</p><p>The &quot;weaponized program&quot; for the 10,000-ton roll-on/roll-off vessel and the &quot;formation of onboard militia and weapons&quot; are intended to weaponize the 10,000-ton roll-on/roll-off vessel for the purpose of disguising it and avoiding U.S. military identification during ocean voyages, and for the purpose of equipping it with missile systems. Since the meeting was an internal confidential meeting, that&#39;s why the participants were so open-mouthed and without worries.</p><p>(2) Assignment of flotilla formation and people and equipment, the PLA&#39;s plan for the staffing of weaponized modified civilian ships is to &quot;optimize the militia on board and adopt a mixed grouping model of main crew, plus veterans, and equipment. The arrangement of veterans and other military personnel on the ship, replacing the real crew, not only affects the efficiency of work, but also the civilian ship owners have to bear the wages of these PLA soldiers, which is a great loss for the civilian ship owners.</p><p>Not only is the military region in Guangdong doing mobilization, but military regions in other Chinese provinces have also been holding similar meetings recently to mobilize for war. The meeting mentioned that &quot;the military cadres accompanying the ships with guns are organized into 3 brigades, 45 squadrons and 135 detachments according to the different items of protection and specific use. Prepare to accompany the ship 231 cadres, including 3 regimental positions, 45 battalion positions, 183 other military and local cadres&quot;, the National Defense Mobilization Center proposed it needs 231 cadres on board, but there is still a shortage of active duty 68 cadres, and 91 local cadres, which is an important military intelligence. This means that it is difficult for the PLA to find experienced cadres at sea, and the 231 cadres on board are currently 68 short. The number of weaponized civilian ships can be calculated from here.</p><p>&quot;Transferred from the mainland military divisions, especially those who have participated in major maritime defense operations, the Navy exchange in the regiment cadres, there are 57, can be added in accordance with the rules&quot;, this information verifies the Lude Media previous expose.</p><p>5\u3001Regarding the combat of novel-domains and capabilities mobilization, several issues such as the equipping of more than 2,000 pieces of high-tech equipment, network and power security during the war, and overseas mobilization were mainly emphasized.</p><p>(1) More than two thousand pieces of high-tech equipments provided, the meeting mentioned that &quot; at present 480 unmanned aircraft and 70 unmanned boats in place. Need to accelerate the timing of the transfer control&quot;. &quot;On the UAV, the province&#39;s mobilization center confirmed the Shenzhen Alltech, Dongguan XX (likely to be Yang Hua) monthly production capacity of 80, it is recommended that the urgent mobilization of Shenzhen Smart Drone UVA, Dongguan Zhongchuang Intelligent Equipment and Guangzhou Hopong Helicopter Remote and other nine enterprises with this production capacity to work together to complete&quot;. &quot;The province&#39;s unmanned boat mobilization center Zhuhai Yunzhou, and Jianglong Shipbuilding monthly production capacity can be 90. Both of these tasks can be completed (enterprise name to be verified)&quot;, the exposure of these companies will allow the U.S. to pay more attention on the production capacity of drones, unmanned boats and related equipment.</p><p>(2) Wartime network and power security, Guangdong Province, through the &quot;mobilization of key high-tech enterprises, such as JiAnxin, Huawei&quot;, as well as &quot;strengthen surveillance and early warning security protection of information systems in the financial, energy, power and transportation industries,&quot; to ensure that the security grid defense of key areas will not be lost.</p><p>(3) For overseas mobilization, Huang Shanchun, Political Commissar of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, mentioned: &quot;By using the methods of covering the army with the people and supporting the army with the people, combining risks and mobilizing the purchase of high-end chips, precision machinery, special materials and other materials that are in short supply in China, as well as petroleum , grain, minerals and other large-scale strategic reserve materials,to crack the dilemma of the U.S. and Western alliances on my strategic materials siege during wartime, vigorously mobilize overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese groups, actively participate in supporting and safeguarding my military operations, increase the introduction of special professionals, aim to all resources worldwide can be used for me, to ensure that foreign aid within the effective, efficient and achievable.&quot; It means that the top CCP has long been aware of the imminent sanctions and blockade of the United States against China, and has been purchasing materials through the Belt and Road Initiative and overseas military-civilian integration projects. The Lude Media has long told everyone that the complete decoupling of the Sino-US industrial chain is unstoppable. The CCP has launched overseas spies like Guo Wengui to infiltrate the US political circles in an attempt to influence the decision to decouple the US from the Chinese industrial chain.</p><p>For the summary of the third part of the meeting, the commander mentioned that &quot;first, strengthening the awareness of the overall situation, focusing on reunification, containing a strategic victory, is the battle of unification, the battle of rejuvenation, can only succeed can not fail, Implement the decision-making intention of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, strengthen political awareness, overall awareness, order awareness, resolutely implement, all energy, focus on the war, all work serves the war, all resources are inclined to war, in order to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland and the greatness of the nation Rejuvenation contributes to Guangdong&#39;s strength.&quot;</p><hr><h3 id="reviews-part-4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reviews-part-4" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reviews Part 4</h3><p>The fourth part: Zhou He, the commander of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, studied and planned ground defense combat missions, and emphasized that &quot;strategic decisive victory: it is a battle of unification, a battle of revival, and it can only succeed but not fail.&quot;</p><p>1\u3001The ground defense operations of the four cities in eastern Guangdong are under the command of the Eastern Theater Command, and 7,000 people are led by the Guangdong Armed Police Corps to participate. From this, it can be seen that the PLA claims to have several million troops, but in fact they are scattered and the local troops are very weak. Even Lude Media has already exposed the news that the CCP&#39;s local military deployment, due to its limited mobilization ability, will not deploy more troops in the four cities of eaeastern Guangdong in the short term.</p><p>2\u3001The meeting mentioned that &quot;important defense targets include important military targets such as theater joint operations command center and maritime operations sub-center, as well as important civilian targets such as Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and South China Power Grid.&quot; Targets in modern warfare are destroyed almost before the battle. This time, the actual capabilities of the PLA&#39;s military and defense deployments have been exposed, and the level of its capabilities is shockingly low.</p><p>3\u3001The meeting mentioned that &quot;there are two options for the use of other assigned forces. First, the centralized use of the Armed Police Guangzhou General Force Mobile Detachment Armed Police Mobile Six Detachment, currently a mobile brigade and part of the 311 brigade of coastal defense forces, a total of about 6,000 people into three mobile groups, allocation in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhanjiang area. The task of mobile back-up and anti-terrorism stability maintenance in the Pearl River Delta and western Guangdong. Second, the use of diversion of the four brigades of the sixth detachments of the armed police mobile about 1,600 people, respectively, assigned to Shanwei, Huizhou, Yangjiang, Heyuan, &quot;that is, Guangdong, Shenzhen and Zhanjiang only 6,000 people garrison (light troops), either all equipped in the Pearl River Delta, otherwise, it would be used in accordance with the &quot;four cities in eastern Guangdong, 1,600 people, Foshan, Zhanjiang, about 500 people by the command of the mobile combat group of 4,000 people in four groups&quot; divided. The PLA calls 6,000 people &quot;a sizable force&quot;, which is a bluff.</p><p>4\u3001The meeting mentioned that &quot;the 208 Coastal defense 311 Brigade has two coastal defense groups, with about 500 people carrying light weapons, which are assigned to the six important military targets of Foshan and Zhanjiang. The defense tasks are heavy and their own defense forces are weak, and should be strengthened.&quot; , which means that the two coastal defense battalions of the 311 Brigade of Haiphong are responsible for the stability maintenance work in Foshan and Zhanjiang. They are composed of 500 soldiers equipped with light weapons. The defense force of only 500 people deployed in the two areas with populations exceeding 10 million is insignificant. The light weapons these 500 soldiers are equipped with are not firearms, but cold weapons such as sticks and steel forks. This is the CCP&#39;s psychological warfare against the Chinese. The CCP wants to use extremely scarce troops to disguise a powerful army, in order to intimidate the Chinese, make the Chinese fear and give up resistance. When the Chinese learn the truth through Lude Media, they will have the confidence to resist the CCP regime.</p><hr><p>Since Lude Media&#39;s intelligence forces have penetrated the highest levels of the Chinese Communist regime, the secret strategies of the Communist Party will be exposed at any time. The world will know the details of their schemes.</p><p>The high value of the recording of this meeting is that, first, it exposes the secret situation of the PLA&#39;s transition from peacetime to wartime and strategic mobilization; second, the strategic mobilization meeting has exposed classified data, location, and deployment.</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party is doing its best to deceive Chinese people to voluntarily go to the front line and take bullets for the Party and die for their country, while they hide themselves in the safety net called &quot; combat command center&quot;. Everything the CCP did was to deceive the Chinese people and sacrifice the lives of Chinese to achieve their welfare. The Chinese Communist Party can directly grab the Chinese people&#39;s production and living materials as war resources in order to prevent the cut-off of supply chains and raw materials in wartime. The CCP&#39;s means of controlling social movement during wartime is the &quot; compulsory zero-tolerance&quot; approach adopted since 2020, in order to achieve grid-based control of the Chinese people. Even in wartime, the CCP does not dare to arm its stabilization forces with guns, and only allows them to use cold weapons such as sticks and steel forks. The CCP&#39;s wartime stability maintenance practice is to deceive the Chinese by using a deception to make Chinese people think that there are many troops to prevent large-scale social disorders, but in fact there are only a limited number of thousands of people, which is a tiny amount for Guangdong, a province with a population of over 100 million. The Chinese people have been deceived and enslaved for too long . Wake up, Chinese people, our awakening will be the time that the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s regime falls apart.</p><p>According to Lude Media &#39;s judgment: (1) ordinary Chinese are please to stay away from the war and not to become the victims of the CCP; (2) the meeting exposed the inferiority of the PLA&#39;s combat skills and that the PLA is definitely going to lose in future wars; (3) the CCP&#39;s regime is at the terminal stage, revealing that the CCP&#39;s mobilization ability has been weakened to a certain extent and it is extremely difficult to mobilize even a few hundred people for war, and it does not dare to arm the stabilization army with guns; (4) the CCP is terribly frightened that the situation in Hong Kong and Macau will affect Guangdong Province if it gets out of hand. (4) The CCP is very scared of &quot;chaos in China with Hong Kong&quot;, in other words, if the situation in Hong Kong and Macau goes out of control, it will lead to instability affecting Guangdong Province, and the CCP is also very scared that Zhanjiang will run out of control, because Zhanjiang is closer to Vietnam, and Lude Media is calling for immediate action by China&#39;s omnipresent fighting forces.</p><h2 id="lude-media-youtube-record" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lude-media-youtube-record" aria-hidden="true">#</a> lude media youtube record</h2>',327),s=n("iframe",{width:"100%",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHZ-49Qhdl4",title:"YouTube video player",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:""},null,-1),h=[r,s];function l(d,c){return t(),i("div",null,h)}var u=e(a,[["render",l],["__file","001.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
