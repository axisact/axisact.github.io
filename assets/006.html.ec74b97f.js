The CCP has made significant accumulation of the original assets through a series of campaigns such as fighting the landlords and dividing up the land and establishing people's communes.This is not only the accumulation of assets, but also the political education and brainwashing of the entire population, as well as a brutal persecution of the groups classified as class enemies. Those who support the CCP are ranked as the masses of the people who either voluntarily or forcibly engage in the campaign to persecute the so-called class enemies of the CCP, such as landlords,capitalists and other groups. Furthermore wholesale collectivization is also a meticulous surveillance and control of each individual. In the 1950s, people were restricted to the region where they were born. In other words, people's activities were restricted within the area where their household registration was issued (the place of household registration is usually the place of birth). If the person wanted to travel outside their birth place, he/she had to have an official letter of introduction, otherwise it was difficult to get out. In the countryside, people were divided into different communes, which were divided into larger groups, medium groups, and smaller groups. Each person is under the supervision of his/her own group leader. People\u2019s basic necessities of life had to obey the rules of the commune, including food, clothing, housing and transportation. For example, they had to work when they were required to work, study when they were required to study, and so on. For the farmers, they had no right to decide what crops to plant, but to follow instructions. Even if the crop requested by the leader to be planted didn't not meet the geographical conditions and may lead to a large-scale underharvest, they must do as they are told. In group life, family members were separated into different labor teams to work. Moreover, families were not allowed to cook, and all the people had to eat collectively in the canteen as required. Therefore, the community members and the group leader, who were responsible for purchasing and cooking, had a firm grip on the lives of the ordinary community members. Many people died of starvation after being punished due to offending the captain or the canteen staff.",-1),f=e("p",null,"Wholesale collectivization was also reflected in the unified management of workers,peasants, businessmen, students, and soldiers (army and militia). The workers, peasants, businessmen, students and soldiers were trained and worked jointly in the commune. They could be dispatched to various places to participate in combat or work at any time, and the work and training they did was not restricted to their capacities; every individual performed different kinds of work or training anytime according to the demand of the group. For example, students and peasants were required to undergo military training, and they would be dispatched to fight as militia when there was a battle operation.Besides training, the soldiers would also help workers and peasants do the work they were required to do.",-1),g=t("To enthusiastically advocate communism and to ensure that the tasks must be accomplished whatever the obstacles and risks is one of the typical manifestations of "),w={href:"http://socialism.In",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},y=t("socialism.In"),v=t(" a brutal and cruel struggle, most people made every attempt to show their loyalty. Wholesale collectivization is a way to accumulate capital, and grain was often one of the main capital accumulated. So during the campaign to guarantee the autumn harvest in the 1950s, each commune bragged about grain production at all costs in order to show their loyalty to the Party. With serious crop boasting, and campaigns such as the launching the satellites 1led to a great famine in which millions of people died. Other than that, the technological revolution was also a manifestation of wholesale collectivization. The massive iron and steel production and the frantic construction of water conservancy projects which cost lots of human and material resources also damaged the natural environment greatly were just examples of efforts trying to surpass the US and UK."),b=l('<p>The successful implementation of wholesale collectivization had to be based on the principle that the controlled population did not have access to goods and that all goods came from the collective contribution. In the 1950s, the people were deprived of the right to buy or sell goods, as well as the right to work as a family basis. It forced all the people to depend on the collective for their survival. For those who did not support the collective, they were brutally persecuted or surrendered in non-stopped denunciation rallies2 .</p><p>Looking back the history, it is obvious that wholesale collectivization accomplished both the political purpose of reconstructing society into a socialist system and the economic purpose of capital accumulation, meanwhile by eliminating private ownership, it deprived almost all individuals the abilities to survive independently, as a result of which civil power was forcefully weakened, basicially three birds one stone .</p><p>It is now several decades away since the wholesale collectivization in the 1950s and 1960s, but the CCP&#39;s wholesale collectivized style of management has never and ever really left us. As long as the CCP needs it, the whole country will immediately go back to the 1950&#39; style. For instance, the family registration\uFF08Hukou\uFF09system. Although the system has been criticized for years, the CCP just won&#39;t abolish it. The CCP can control people&#39;s freedom of migration through the Hukou system, and it can be said that the hukou system is the most powerful tool to keep people firmly in the place where they were born. Moreover, there is no protection for private property under the Chinese communist system, and the most typical example is that people only have the right to live in the house, but not the right to possess the land or the house. As a result, there have been more and more cases of forced removals from private property in various regions in China. (Because the Party wants to use the land for expropriation).</p><p>During the pandemic, the CCP, under Xi Jinping&#39;s leadership, has moved from a status of keeping a low profile to a state of hostility with all democratic countries. This global outbreak pandemic was the beginning of a declaration of war against all freedom and democracy countries by the Chinese Communist Party through unleashing biological weapons across the world. According to President Joe Biden, who revealed the contents of a conference call with Xi Jinping in his graduation speech at the U.S. Naval Academy on May 27, 2022, Xi told Biden that \u201CDemocracies cannot be sustained in the 21st century. Autocracies will run the world.\u201D This explicitly unveiled Xi&#39;s ambition to let the Communist Party&#39;s dictatorial system dominate the world and raise the red brand of socialism all over the world.</p><h2 id="national-war-time-management-and-wholesale-collectivization-at-present" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#national-war-time-management-and-wholesale-collectivization-at-present" aria-hidden="true">#</a> National War Time Management and wholesale collectivization at present</h2><p>The Peacetime to Wartime Transition, as mentioned in this expanded meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, is to transit the whole country from peacetime to war state with all speed. The whole country is governed by wartime management. This wartime management is to bring China back to a state of wholesale collectivization again at this point and have everyone in the country obey the command uniformly.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the basic requirement for the implementation of wholesale collectivization is that the people have no independent source of life necessities.The perfect entry point for this purpose in the world today is to use the pandemic to lock down the public. Although people have money on hand, they were unable to obtain enough living supplies under severe quarantine conditions. As a result, the population would have to rely on government supplies to feed themselves.</p><p>In order to lockdown smoothly, a lot of propaganda work was necessary. Both the news in the mainstream media and the self-media were all actively promoting the benefits of the lockdown. Not only did they make a lot of propaganda in China, the CCP also infiltrated overseas media and created overseas influencers. With long-term infiltration, the CCP gains the power to either silence the media on the matter or propagate its validity.</p><p>Anyone who dares to oppose the CCP or question it in public will be retaliated by the CCP. Individuals in general are likely to be threatened with imprisonment, while for those with a particular social status the CCP will try to utilize the power of the media to suppress and smear them.</p><p>Private property is being further violated in China today in a situation where private property is already not respected. During the epidemic, many areas require people in centralized quarantine to leave their keys to pandemic prevention and control personnel. If they disobey, the epidemic prevention officers will forcibly break into their homes. It is common to see furniture and personal property lost or damaged.</p><p>The Communist Party is even more greedy in depriving enterprises of their assets. In the past two years, enterprises have been required to set up Party Branches, so that the privately owned enterprises would be transformed under direct management by the CCP. As for the large corporations, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) will control them by purchasing shares or acquisition. The double reduction (Refers to effectively reducing the burden of excessive homework and off-campus training for students in the compulsory education stage) campaign that emerged after 2020 resulted in the closure of a large number of private education and training enterprises. The CCP required these collapsed companies to sign donation agreements to convert private education and training companies into non-profit organizations. In the name of &quot;donations,&quot; the Chinese government robbed business owners of their assets. Compared to the barbaric practices of the 1950s, when the land was divided between the rich and the poor and Joint State-Private Enterprises, today&#39;s private-sector robberies are dressed up in the legal appearance. Although it is done in accordance with the law, in essence, it is an unbridled depredation of private assets under the weight of bad laws.</p><p>The CCP is rolling out a nationwide system of social control known as \u201Cgrid management\u201D in a revival of state presence in residential life. The Communist Party divides the residents into grids, with about 15-20 households in a grid, and each grid has a grid leader and a grid manager. Grid leaders are directly appointed by the communist party. All the residents live an almost transparent life under the grid management. The grid managers even develop their own assets among the residents to keep track of every household.</p><p>Wholesale collectivized lifestyle is also a way to force individuals to change their ways of life to a uniformed one. Pandemic lockdown is a means of changing living habits. For example, people are classified and ruled by different travel codes. It is up to the central management to decide where and when you are allowed to go, when and where you are locked. Under such circumstances, even if there is no clear official prohibition of cross-zone travel, people will consciously reduce their travel in order to reduce the trouble. In addition, the frequent and long-term nucleic acid tests under the disguise of pandemic prevention, going to designated places for tests, shopping during specified hours, etc, are all alterations to people&#39; lifestyle behavior. Many people complained about these rules at first, but over time, they got used to them. Once the residents get used to these changes, the wholesale collectivization management will become smoother and smoother.</p><p>People who opposed wholesale collectivization were labeled as class enemies and would be publicly humiliated, accused, beaten and tortured at denunciation rallies in 1950s. Today the class enemy is no longer the3 five black categories (landlords, wealthy farmers, Bad influencers, Counter-revolutionaries, and right wingers) but those who have violated the rules of the pandemic prevention and who are described as selfish, irresponsible people without regard for the public health of society and with contempt for life and health. Their information will be presented to the public, driven by the media, which will raise wave after wave of open criticism of these people.</p><p>On the issue of food cultivation, the Chinese communist party once again raised the slogan of grasping production, and the whole country launched a big movement of &quot;returning forests to farmland&quot;. Without regard to the farmers&#39; losses, the communist party forcibly destroyed the existing fruit and vegetable plantations and replaced them with grain, and in some places, in order to &quot;guarantee&quot; the area of cultivated land, they laid soil on asphalt roads and planted grain on it. This kind of movement to grasp grain production without regard to the laws of nature and the will of the farmers will result in a huge grain problem for China.</p><p>The militia system has always been a very important force for the Chinese Communist Party. It has always been the CCP&#39;s theory to have all the people participate in the war. In this extended meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the concept of people&#39;s war was high-frequently mentioned. The meeting specifically pointed out the importance of having fishing boats and ro-ro ships to be equipped with weapon systems to join the war. If we closely explore the information, the technology related to the weaponization of civilian vessels was already very well developed 20 years ago in China. The Chinese Communist Party has a long term strategy for unleashing a people&#39;s war from sea, they are just waiting for the perfect time to do so.</p><p>By comparing how the CCP manages China today with that of the 1950s, it is not difficult to tell that there are shocking similarities between these two eras. Today&#39;s CCP has ignited a war in the world, and in order to win they must have a stable backyard. That is why strict and tight wholesale collectivization, or the all-in-one control of the country, where all actions are under same command, is the cornerstone to stabilize the system.</p><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-hidden="true">#</a> References</h2><p>Wang Lixin, Chen Qiansi, Jiang Lingxiao, Tang Yifen, King &amp; Wood Mallesons&#39; Finance &amp; Securities Department (2021).</p>',19),_={href:"https://www.chinalawinsight.com/2021/09/articles/education/%E5%8F%8C%E5%87%8F%E6%94%BF%E7%AD%96%E4%B9%8B%E4%B8%8B%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%99%E5%9F%B9%E6%9C%BA%E6%9E%84%E8%B7%AF%E5%9C%A8%E4%BD%95%E6%96%B9%EF%BC%9F",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},C=t('Under the "Double Reduction Policy", Where is the Road for Education and Training Institutions?'),k=e("p",null,"Hao, Peng (2020, September).
